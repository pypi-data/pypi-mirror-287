Description: COPASI is a software application for simulation and analysis of 
	biochemical networks and their dynamics. COPASI is a stand-alone program that 
	supports models in the SBML standard and can simulate their behavior using 
	ODEs or Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm; arbitrary discrete events 
	can be included in such simulations.
