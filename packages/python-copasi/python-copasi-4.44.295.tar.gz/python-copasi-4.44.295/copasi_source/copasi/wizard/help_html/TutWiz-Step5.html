		<h3>Step 5: Creating a Report Definition</h3><br>
	</div>
	<p>
		Sometimes, the predefined report and plots that are provided by the <em>Output
			Assistant</em> are not what you want. In this case, we can either start with
		one of the predefined report (or plots) and change it to our needs, or we can
		create a new report (or plot) from scratch.
		In order to create or edit an exisiting report definition, you navigate in the tree to
		<code>Output-&gt;Reports</code>. If you want to edit an exisiting report, just double click on the report you
		want to edit in the table. If you want to create a new report, click the <strong><code>New</code></strong>
		button on the bottom then double click on the new entry in the table. You will now find
		yourself in the dialog for the report definition.<br>
	<div style="text-align:center;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
		(<a href="#Report Definition" name="Report Definition">Click here</a> to go to the Report definition dialog.)
	</div>
	<br>
	<div style="text-align:center;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

	</div>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have created a new report, the list widget is empty. That means that nothing will be put into the
		report. In order to add items for the output, you click on the <strong><code>Item</code></strong> button which
		is located to the right of the empty list. This will open the <em>Object Browser</em>
		dialog where you can select any available object. We will now limit
		ourselves to the <em>time</em> object and the concentrations of the species.
		Expand Species -> Transient Concentrations and select the ones you want in the report (drag or Cmd/Ctrl to
		select). Also select Time -> Model Time (still with Cmd or Ctrl pressed). You may also check the box to work in
		<em>expert mode</em>. This exposes the objects, references, and attributes, by actual internal object name, to
		allow for fuller control.

	</div>
	<br>
	Once you have selected all the attributes for the output, you finish the
	selection by clicking the <strong><code>"OK"</code></strong> button.
	</p>
	<p>
		The attributes that you see in the list widget now, will be written to file
		in same the order as the appear in the list. If you want the time
		to appear in the first column of your output instead of the last, you have to change the order of the selected
		elements.
		You can change the order of the elements by selecting an item in the list and moving it up or down via the
		<code><strong>Up</strong></code> and
		<code><strong>Down</strong></code> buttons on the left.
		You can also delete an element by selecting it and then pushing the <strong><code>Delete</code></strong> button.
