This is the linux build of a Copasi test version.

INSTALLATION:

You can unpack the package anywhere. The binary should work immediatly.
However for the tutorial wizard to work you need to set an environment
variable:


If you use bash type (while replacing <copasi-path> with the directory where 
you installed Copasi):

export COPASI_HELP_PATH=<copasi-path>/share/doc/copasi

If you want to use that permanently you can add that command to your .bashrc
file.


If you use tcsh type (while replacing <copasi-path> with the directory where 
you installed Copasi):

setenv COPASI_HELP_PATH <copasi-path>/share/doc/copasi

GNOME and KDE users:

To integrate Copasi into the Gnome or KDE environments follow the instructions on http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/integrating_gnome.html or use kmenuedit respectively. You will find the appropriate Copasi icons in the Copasi installation directory.

KNOWN PROBLEMS

We built this as a statically linked binary. It should therefor run on most
Linux x86 computers.
