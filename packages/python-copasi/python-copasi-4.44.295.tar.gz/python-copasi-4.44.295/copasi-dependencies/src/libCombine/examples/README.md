# Examples

We have some rudimentary examples available that demonstrate how to use the library to read elements `printArchive` and write `createArchive` to / from Combine Archives. The C++, C# and Java examples will be automatically compiled by the CMake projects if the CMake option `-DWITH_EXAMPLES=ON` has been set (and of course for C# you would need `-DWITH_CSHARP=ON` and Java `-DWITH_JAVA=ON`).

## Create Archive
This basic examples shows how to create a COMBINE archive. 

* [C++](https://github.com/sbmlteam/libCombine/blob/master/examples/c%2B%2B/create_archive.cpp)
* [C#](https://github.com/sbmlteam/libCombine/blob/master/examples/csharp/CreateArchiveExample.cs)
* [Java](https://github.com/sbmlteam/libCombine/blob/master/examples/java/createArchiveExample.java)
* [Python](https://github.com/sbmlteam/libCombine/blob/master/examples/python/createArchiveExample.py)

## Print Archive
This example demonstrates accessing a COMBINE archive including the metadata elements.   

* [C++](https://github.com/sbmlteam/libCombine/blob/master/examples/c++/print_archive.cpp)
* [C#](https://github.com/sbmlteam/libCombine/blob/master/examples/csharp/PrintExample.cs)
* [Java](https://github.com/sbmlteam/libCombine/blob/master/examples/java/printExample.java)
* [Python](https://github.com/sbmlteam/libCombine/blob/master/examples/python/printExample.py)
