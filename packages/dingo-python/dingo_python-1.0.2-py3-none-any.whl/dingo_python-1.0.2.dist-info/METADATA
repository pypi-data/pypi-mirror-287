# Introduction

Dingo is a data quality assessment tool that helps you automatically detect data quality issues in your datasets. Dingo provides a variety of built-in detection rules and model methods, and also supports custom detection methods. It supports commonly used NLP datasets and multimodal datasets, including pre-training datasets, fine-tuning datasets, and evaluation datasets. In addition, Dingo supports various interface usage methods, including local CLI, SDK, and RESTFul API, making it easy to integrate into various environments. The large model evaluation platform of [OpenCompass](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass) has integrated Dingo for subjective evaluation of language model generated content.

## Architecture of Dingo

![Architecture of dingo](./docs/assets/architeture.png)

# QuickStart

Install `dingo`.
```shell
pip install dingo
```

Try the following `SDK Mode` demo code:
```python
from dingo.model import Model
from dingo.io import RawInputModel
from dingo.exec import Executor

input_data = {
    "eval_models": ["sft"],
    "input_path": "tatsu-lab/alpaca", # replace with your data path here
    "data_format": "plaintext",
}

raw_input = RawInputModel(**input_data)
Model.apply_config(raw_input.custom_config_path)
executor = Executor.exec_map["local"](raw_input)
result = executor.evaluate()
print(result)
```

you can also try `CLI Mode`:
```shell
python -m dingo.run.cli --input_path tatsu-lab/alpaca -e sft --data_format plaintext
```

# Tutorials

## Config

`Dingo` enables users to personalize their data quality inspection methods, which can include the use of heuristic rules, 
third-party quality inspection tools or services, and large models. These can be implemented through configuration. 
Specifically, users can pass a parameter named `custom_config_path` which points to a configuration file. 
Below is a template for this configuration file: [template.json](data/inputs/config/template.json)

### Rules

Heuristic rules are a common method for data processing and quality inspection. `Dingo` has implemented a series of 
heuristic rules and grouped them into rule groups, such as `zh-all`, and `en-all`, which represent the heuristic quality 
inspection rule sets for Chinese and English respectively. In the template of the configuration file, the two configuration 
items related to heuristic rule configuration are `custom_rule_list` and `rule_config`, which represent the rule set 
and the configuration parameters for a specific rule, respectively. Below is a configuration example:
``` json
{
  "custom_rule_list": [],
  "rule_config": {}
}
```
### Large Models

`Dingo` supports data quality inspection using large models. Before use, users need to configure `llm_config`. 
For `OpenAI` models:
``` json
{
  "key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
```
For HuggingFace models(currently support the downloaded models):
``` json
{
  "path": "your local model path",
}
```

## Execute

`Dingo` can be run locally or on a Spark cluster.

### Local Mode

In addition to the aforementioned SDK calls, you can also run data evaluation locally with `CLI`:

```shell
python -m dingo.run.cli
```

The CLI parameters are as follows.

| parameter name          | description                                                       |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-i` or `--input_path`  | The path of data. It can be a file or a directory.                |
| `-e` or `--eval_models` | The model used to evaluate data quality.                          |
| `--dataset_id`          | The id of data input.                                             |
| `--data_type`           | The type of data. It can be JSON, jsonl, plaintext and list json. |
| `--output_path`         | The path of result data.                                          |
| `--column_id`           | The column name of id in data.                                    |
| `--column_prompt`       | The column name of prompt in data.                                |
| `--column_content`      | The column name of content in data.                               |
| `custom_config_path`    | The path of custom config file.                                   |

More information can be obtained by running the following command: `python -m dingo.run.cli --help`.

### Spark Mode

If the scale of data is very large you can use Spark to run the project. 

Firstly, create an object from `SparkExecutor`, and set the actual instances of SparkSession and DataFrame.

```python
from dingo.exec.spark import SparkExecutor

spark_exec = SparkExecutor()
spark_exec.set_spark(spark_session)
spark_exec.set_input_df(spark_data_frame)
```

Then, convert the data and execute the rule list.

```python
spark_exec.convert_data(column_id=['data_id'], column_prompt=['prompt'], column_content=['content'])
spark_exec.execute(["CommonSpecialCharacter", "CommonColonEnd"])

```

Finally, summarize and get the result data.

```python
spark_exec.summarize()
output_df = spark_exec.get_output_df()
summary = spark_exec.get_summary()
```


## Evaluation Results

### Summary

The `summary.json` file is overall information about evaluation results. Here is an example: 

```
{
    "dataset_id": "20240618",
    "input_model": "default",
    "input_path": "data/inputs/test_data1.json",
    "output_path": "data/outputs/20240625_134409",
    "score": 90.0,
    "num_good": 90,
    "num_bad": 10,
    "total": 100,
    "error_ratio": {...}
}
```

The `error_ratio` field shows data quality signals in seven different aspects: 
`EFFECTIVENESS`, `COMPLETENESS`, `UNDERSTANDABILITY`, `SIMILARITY`, `FLUENCY`, `RELEVANCE` and `SECURITY`.

### Detailed Results

For more detailed issues found in data items, `Dingo` created files in a directory named with the quality signals mentioned above.
Give an example. `CommonColonEnd.json` in the `QUALITY_SIGNAL_COMPLETENESS` directory is as follows:

```
{
    "name": "CommonColonEnd", # rule name
    "count": 1,
    "ratio": 0.5,
    "detail": [
        {
            "data_id": "0",
            "prompt": "",
            "content": "I am 8 years old. ^I love apple because:",
            "error_reason": "Ends with a colon."
        }
    ]
}
```

We evaluated the quality of these three datasets based on `Dingo`.

| Dataset         | Dataset Type | EFFECTIVENESS | COMPLETENESS | UNDERSTANDABILITY | SIMILARITY | FLUENCY | RELEVANCE | SECURITY |
