**GraphPack** is a Python tool engineered to facilitate the compression and visualization of large-scale networks, such
as protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks or metabolic pathways. It offers a user-friendly interface that enables
the application of diverse graph compression algorithms and the visualization of the original and compressed networks.
