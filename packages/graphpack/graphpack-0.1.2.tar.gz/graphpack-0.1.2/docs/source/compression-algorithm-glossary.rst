   Louvain Clustering
        Louvain Community Detection algorithm (:cite:t:`louvain`) is used in compressing large-scale gene networks by
        identifying densely connected subgroups of nodes. This is a heuristic method based on modularity optimization.

            .. admonition:: Parameters and Hints

                 ``resolution``: Controls the size of the communities. Higher values lead to smaller communities.

                 ✅ Efficient for large networks.

                 ✅ Provides high modularity scores.

                 ⚠️ May result in overly large communities if the resolution parameter is not well-tuned.


   Greedy Algorithm
        This method uses Clauset-Newman-Moore greedy modularity maximization (:cite:t:`greedy`) to find the community
        partition with the largest modularity. It iteratively merges nodes to minimize the graph size while preserving
        its structure.

                 ``resolution``: Controls the size of the communities. Higher values lead to smaller communities.

                 ✅ Can be applied to weighted and unweighted graphs.

                 ⚠️ May not provide the optimal solution compared to more sophisticated methods.


   Label Propagation
        Label Propagation (:cite:t:`label_propagation`) can compress networks by propagating labels across the network
        to identify and merge similar node communities. The algorithm is probabilistic and the found communities may
        vary in different executions.

                 ⚠️ Can produce different results on different runs due to its stochastic nature.


   Asynchronous Fluid Communities
        The asynchronous fluid communities algorithm (:cite:t:`asyn_fluidc`) is based on the simple idea of fluids
        interacting in an environment, expanding and pushing each other. Its initialization is random, so found
        communities may vary on different executions.

                 ✅ Captures fluid and overlapping communities.

                 ⚠️ Requires the graph to be connected.

                 ⚠️ May produce different results on different runs due to random initialization.


   Spectral Clustering
        Spectral clustering (:cite:t:`spectral`), applied to community detection task by using the adjacency matrix as
        affinity, utilizes graph Laplacian eigenstructure to partition the graph into clusters. This method is effective
        for identifying complex, non-convex cluster shapes like nested circles on a 2D plane. By specifying
        ``affinity='precomputed'``, and providing the adjacency matrix as input, it is possible to accurately identify
        densely connected subgraphs (communities) within the network.

   Hierarchical Clustering
        Agglomerative clustering, applied to community detection tasks by utilizing the adjacency
        matrix as the metric, merges the most similar communities iteratively. This method is effective for identifying
        hierarchical structures within networks, where nodes are progressively merged based on their pairwise distances.

        Node2Vec (:cite:t:`node2vec`), applied to community detection tasks, embeds nodes through biased random walks to
        capture complex relationships within the network. These embeddings can then be clustered to identify communities.

        structures.
