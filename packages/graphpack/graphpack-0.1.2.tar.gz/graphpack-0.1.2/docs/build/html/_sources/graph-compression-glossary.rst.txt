Graph Compression Glossary
==========================

.. glossary::

    Network
        A network is a collection of entities (such as proteins or genes) and relationships between the entities
        (such as protein-protein interactions, gene co-expression, transcriptional regulation, or similarities).

        Networks are used to model complex systems in a wide range of fields, including biology, social science,
        and computer science. Their structure can be visualized as a :term:`graph`.

    Graph
        A graph is a mathematical representation of a network, consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges (links) that
        connect the nodes. Graphs are used to model any complex system that can be represented as a network.

    Graph Compression
        Graph compression (:cite:t:`compression`) is intended as the process of reducing the size of a network while
        preserving its :term:`structural properties`. This is achieved by identifying and merging similar nodes
        (:term:`community`) and/or edges.

        One of the main goals of graph compression is to simplify the network structure, making it easier to analyze
        and visualize. This process is particularly useful for large-scale networks, where the sheer number of nodes
        and edges can make it difficult to interpret the underlying relationships.

    Lossless Compression
        Lossless compression is a type of data compression that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed
        from the compressed data. This means that no information is lost during the compression process.

        Lossless compression algorithms are commonly used in graph compression to reduce the size of a network without
        losing any of the underlying structure. It is commonly achieved by producing, in addition to the compressed
        network, a set of instructions that can be used to reconstruct the original network (for example, a mapping of
        the nodes in the compressed network to the nodes in the original network, and a list of edges to add to/remove
        from the reconstructed network; :cite:t:`mdl`).

        .. note::
            Lossless compression algorithms are typically more computationally intensive than lossy compression
            algorithms, as they must preserve all of the original data, especially in the case of large-scale networks.

    Minimum Description Length
        The minimum description length (MDL) principle is a method for selecting the best model from a set of
        competing models. The MDL principle states that the best model is the one that minimizes the total length
        of the model description and the data needed to reconstruct the original network.

        In the context of graph compression, the MDL principle can be used to select the best compression algorithm
        for a given network. By comparing the total length of the compressed network and the data needed to reconstruct
        the original network, it is possible to identify the most effective compression algorithm.

    Community
        A community is a group of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network.
        Community is a key concept in graph theory and network analysis, as it serves as a proxy for potentially
        relevant functional modules of the original network, such as protein complexes or metabolic pathways.

    Community Detection
        Community detection is the process of identifying clusters of nodes in a network.

        There are many different community detection algorithms available. Some algorithms are based on the structure
        of the network (for example, the density of connections between nodes), while others use statistical methods
        to identify communities (such as modularity optimization).

    Compression Algorithm
        A compression algorithm is a set of rules and procedures used to reduce the size of a network. These algorithms
        typically identify and merge similar nodes and/or edges, resulting in a simplified network structure that tries
        to retain the essential relationships between nodes.

        There are many different compression algorithms available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some
        algorithms are designed to work with specific types of networks, such as social networks or biological networks,
        while others are more general-purpose and can be applied to a wide range of network types. For further details,
        see :ref:`compression algorithm glossary`.

    Node Embedding
        Node embedding is a technique used to represent nodes in a network as vectors in a low-dimensional space. These
        vector representations capture the topological properties of the network, allowing for efficient analysis and
        visualization. Node embedding is often used in conjunction with compression algorithms to simplify the network
        structure while preserving the essential relationships between nodes.

    Random Walk
        A random walk is a mathematical process that describes a path through a network in which each step is chosen
        randomly. Random walks are often used to explore the structure of a network and identify important nodes and
        edges. Random walks can be used in compression algorithms to generate node embeddings.

    Structural Properties
        The structural properties of a network refer to the arrangement of nodes and edges within the network. These
        properties include the degree distribution, clustering coefficient, degree centrality, and modularity.

        The structural properties of a network are important for understanding its behavior and function. By analyzing
        these properties, it is possible to identify key nodes and edges, detect communities, and predict how the network
        will evolve over time.
