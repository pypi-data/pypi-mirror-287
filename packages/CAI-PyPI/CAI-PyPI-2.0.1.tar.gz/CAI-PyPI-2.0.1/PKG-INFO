CAI-PyPI: An updated version of the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) package

This package is based on the original CAI project by Benjamin Lee (https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/CodonAdaptationIndex). It has been updated to resolve compatibility issues with PyPI and ensure the latest version is easily accessible via pip. While maintaining the core functionality of the original project, this version aims to provide a smoother installation process and better integration with PyPI.

# Python Codon Adaptation Index (CAI-PyPI)

![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/CAI-PyPI.svg)

This is a fork of the original [Codon Adaptation Index](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/CodonAdaptationIndex) project by Benjamin Lee. It has been updated to resolve compatibility issues with PyPI and ensure the latest version is easily accessible via pip.

An implementation of [Sharp and Li's 1987 formulation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC340524/pdf/nar00247-0410.pdf) of the [codon adaption index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codon_Adaptation_Index).

## Why This Fork?

The original CAI package had some issues with PyPI compatibility, making it difficult for users to install via pip. This fork (CAI-PyPI) addresses these issues, providing a smoother installation process and better integration with PyPI. While maintaining the core functionality of the original project, CAI-PyPI ensures that users can easily access and use the latest version of the Codon Adaptation Index implementation.

## Installation

### Installing CAI-PyPI (Recommended)

This forked version is available from PyPI and can be downloaded with the following command:

```
$ pip install CAI-PyPI
```

### Installing the Original CAI (For Reference)

The original module is available from PyPI and can be downloaded with the following command:

```
$ pip install CAI
```

To install the latest development version of the original project:

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/CodonAdaptationIndex.git
```

## Quickstart

Finding the CAI of a sequence is easy:

```python
>>> from CAI import CAI
>>> CAI("ATG...", reference=["ATGTTT...", "ATGCGC...",...])
0.24948128951724224
```

Similarly, from the command line:

```
$ CAI -s sequence.fasta -r reference_sequences.fasta
0.24948128951724224
```

Determining which sequences to use as the reference set is left to the user, though the [HEG-DB](http://genomes.urv.cat/HEG-DB/) is a great resource of highly expressed genes.
