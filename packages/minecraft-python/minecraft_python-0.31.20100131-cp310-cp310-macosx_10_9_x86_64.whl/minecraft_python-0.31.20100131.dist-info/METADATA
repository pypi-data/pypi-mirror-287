## Minecraft: Python Edition

![Minecraft](/screenshot.png?raw=true)

_**Minecraft: Python Edition**_ is a project that strives to recreate each and every old Minecraft version in Python 3 using the **Pyglet** multimedia library and **Cython** for performance.

The project is currently working on the Indev versions of Minecraft.
The latest version is **Indev 0.31 20100131** as released on _**January 31, 2010**_.

This version adds the main menu, passive human mobs, and item durability to the game.

Features from previous Indev versions include the Indev mossy cobblestone spawn house, NBT level file saving,
tools, torches, advanced liquid spread, TNT explosives, chests, workbench crafting, and soup.

To easily install this version of *Minecraft: Python Edition*, just run `python -m pip install minecraft-python==0.31.20100131`.

You can learn more about this version [on the Minecraft wiki.](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_Indev_0.31_20100131)

### Organization

This project's commits represent the Python versions of each Minecraft Java game version.
You can view source code changes between game versions by checking the commit history or comparing branches.
To play any version, specify it in the `pip install` command as demonstrated below.

### General Usage

*Pyglet*, *Cython*, *Pillow*, *PyOgg*, *NumPy*, and *nbtlib* are required dependencies which can easily be installed with *pip*. Use the versions specified in `requirements.txt`.
*wxPython* is an optional dependency for the level file picker, but if you don't have it then *Tkinter* is used instead.

For audio to work you will either need *PyOgg* which is recommended, or *FFmpeg* which has to be installed on your system.
*GStreamer* is also supported on Linux through the *gst-python* library.
PyOgg requires that your system have one of the Opus, FLAC, or Vorbis codecs.
*OpenAL* is required and comes bundled with the source on Windows.

For a manual Cython source build, run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`.

Run `python -m mc.net.minecraft.client.Minecraft` to launch the game. *Minecraft: Python Edition* should be compatible with any modern platform that supports OpenGL and Cython.

Run with the argument `-fullscreen` to open the window in fullscreen mode (or press F11 in-game).
The argument `-creative` will force the game to be in creative mode.

### Gameplay

All controls are as you would expect for the game and they can be configured in the options menu.
Press I to open your inventory, F5 to toggle rain and F7 to take a cool isometric screenshot.

Smelting is unique in early Indev: to get iron or gold ingots, light the dropped ores on fire or throw them in lava.

The Indev level generator is customizable and you can choose between the *Inland*, *Island*, *Floating*, and *Flat* level types.
You can specify the world theme as *Normal* or *Hell* (lava and dirt instead of water and grass), world size, and world shape (*Square*, *Long*, *Deep*).

Levels can be saved to a single *.mclevel* NBT file in the pause menu. The level files are perfectly compatible with Java and vice versa.

Humans may drop string on death, gunpowder, or feathers upon death.

Crafted mushroom bowl soup will restore health. Check the Wiki for crafting recipes added in this version.

### Additional Notes

The `mc.resources` directory contains all of the textures and sounds that this version uses. However,
the textures are only there for convenience, as all of the texture buffers are already preloaded
in the `mc.Resources` module.

This would have been much more challenging to work on without the great tools provided by [RetroMCP-Java](https://github.com/MCPHackers/RetroMCP-Java).
