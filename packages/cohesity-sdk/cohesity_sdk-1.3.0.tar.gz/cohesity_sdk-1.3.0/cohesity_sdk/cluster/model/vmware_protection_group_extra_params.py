        Keyword Args:
            _check_type (bool): if True, values for parameters in openapi_types
                                will be type checked and a TypeError will be
                                raised if the wrong type is input.
                                Defaults to True
            _path_to_item (tuple/list): This is a list of keys or values to
                                drill down to the model in received_data
                                when deserializing a response
            _spec_property_naming (bool): True if the variable names in the input data
                                are serialized names, as specified in the OpenAPI document.
                                False if the variable names in the input data
                                are pythonic names, e.g. snake case (default)
            _configuration (Configuration): the instance to use when
                                deserializing a file_type parameter.
                                If passed, type conversion is attempted
                                If omitted no type conversion is done.
            _visited_composed_classes (tuple): This stores a tuple of
                                classes that we have traveled through so that
                                if we see that class again we will not use its
                                discriminator again.
                                When traveling through a discriminator, the

                                For example if Animal has a discriminator
                                petType and we pass in "Dog", and the class Dog
                                allOf includes Animal, we move through Animal
                                once using the discriminator, and pick Dog.
                                Then in Dog, we will make an instance of the
                                Animal class but this time we won't travel
                                through its discriminator because we passed in

            allow_parallel_runs (bool, none_type): Specifies whether or not this job can have parallel runs.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            cloud_migration (bool, none_type): Specifies whether or not to move the workload to the cloud.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            exclude_filters ([VMFilter], none_type): Specifies the list of exclusion filters applied during the group creation or edit. These exclusion filters can be wildcard supported strings or regular expressions. Objects satisfying these filters will be excluded during backup and also auto protected objects will be ignored if filtered by any of the filters.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            exclude_object_ids ([int, none_type]): Specifies the list of IDs of the objects to not be protected in this backup. This field only applies if provided object id is non leaf entity such as Tag or a folder. This can be used to ignore specific objects under a parent object which has been included for protection.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            exclude_vm_tag_ids ([[int]]): Array of Arrays of VM Tag Ids that Specify VMs to Exclude. Optionally specify a list of VMs to exclude from protecting by listing Protection Source ids of VM Tags in this two dimensional array. Using this two dimensional array of Tag ids, the Cluster generates a list of VMs to exclude from protecting, which are derived from intersections of the inner arrays and union of the outer array, as shown by the following example. For example a Datacenter is selected to be protected but you want to exclude all the 'Former Employees' VMs in the East and West but keep all the VMs for 'Former Employees' in the South which are also stored in this Datacenter, by specifying the following tag id array: [ [1000, 2221], [1000, 3031] ], where 1000 is the 'Former Employee' VM Tag id, 2221 is the 'East' VM Tag id and 3031 is the 'West' VM Tag id. The first inner array [1000, 2221] produces a list of VMs that are both tagged with 'Former Employees' and 'East' (an intersection). The second inner array [1000, 3031] produces a list of VMs that are both tagged with 'Former Employees' and 'West' (an intersection). The outer array combines the list of VMs from the two inner arrays. The list of resulting VMs are excluded from being protected this Job.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            leverage_hyperflex_snapshots (bool, none_type): Whether to leverage the hyperflex based snapshots for this backup. To leverage hyperflex snapshots, it has to first be registered. If hyperflex based snapshots cannot be taken, backup will fallback to the default backup method.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            leverage_nutanix_snapshots (bool, none_type): Whether to leverage the nutanix based snapshots for this backup. To leverage nutanix snapshots, it has to first be registered. If nutanix based snapshots cannot be taken, backup will fallback to the default backup method.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            leverage_storage_snapshots (bool, none_type): Whether to leverage the storage array based snapshots for this backup. To leverage storage snapshots, the storage array has to be registered as a source. If storage based snapshots can not be taken, backup will fallback to the default backup method.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            source_id (int, none_type): Specifies the id of the parent of the objects.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            source_name (str, none_type): Specifies the name of the parent of the objects.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
            vm_tag_ids ([[int]], none_type): Array of Array of VM Tag Ids that Specify VMs to Protect. Optionally specify a list of VMs to protect by listing Protection Source ids of VM Tags in this two dimensional array. Using this two dimensional array of Tag ids, the Cluster generates a list of VMs to protect which are derived from intersections of the inner arrays and union of the outer array, as shown by the following example. To protect only 'Eng' VMs in the East and all the VMs in the West, specify the following tag id array: [ [1101, 2221], [3031] ], where 1101 is the 'Eng' VM Tag id, 2221 is the 'East' VM Tag id and 3031 is the 'West' VM Tag id. The inner array [1101, 2221] produces a list of VMs that are both tagged with 'Eng' and 'East' (an intersection). The outer array combines the list from the inner array with list of VMs tagged with 'West' (a union). The list of resulting VMs are protected by this Protection Group.. [optional]  # noqa: E501
