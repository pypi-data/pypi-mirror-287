QIR interface for the qoqo quantum toolkit by [HQS Quantum Simulations](https://quantumsimulations.de).

qoqo-qir provides the QirBackend class that allows users translate a qoqo circuit into a QIR file.
Not all qoqo operations have a corresponding QIR expression.  
Circuits containing operations without a corresponding expression cannot be translated.

If you intend to use the produced QIR expression with the QIR alliance's QIR-runner you should use the measure_all argument.

A source distribution now exists but requires a Rust install with a rust version > 1.47 and a maturin version { >= 0.14, <0.15 } in order to be built.
