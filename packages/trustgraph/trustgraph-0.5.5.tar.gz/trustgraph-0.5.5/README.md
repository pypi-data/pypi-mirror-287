# TrustGraph

## Introduction

TrustGraph is a true end-to-end (e2e) knowledge pipeline that performs a `naive extraction` on a text corpus
to build a RDF style knowledge graph coupled with a `RAG` service compatible with cloud LLMs and open-source
SLMs (Small Language Models).

The pipeline processing components are interconnected with a pub/sub engine to
maximize modularity and enable new knowledge processing functions. The core processing components decode documents, 
chunk text, perform embeddings, apply a local SLM/LLM, call a LLM API, and generate LM predictions.

The processing showcases the reliability and efficiences of Graph RAG algorithms which can capture
contextual language flags that are missed in conventional RAG approaches. Graph querying algorithms enable retrieving
not just relevant knowledge but language cues essential to understanding semantic uses unique to a text corpus.

Processing modules are executed in containers.  Processing can be scaled-up
by deploying multiple containers.

### Features

- Storing embeddings in [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus)
- Embedding query service
- Graph RAG query service
- All procesing integrates with [Apache Pulsar](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/)
- Containers, so can be deployed using Docker Compose or Kubernetes
- Plug'n'play architecture: switch different LLM modules to suit your needs

## Architecture

![architecture](architecture.png)

TrustGraph is designed to be modular to support as many Language Models and environments as possible. A natural
fit for a modular architecture is to decompose functions into a set modules connected through a pub/sub backbone.
[Apache Pulsar](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/) serves as this pub/sub backbone. Pulsar acts as the data broker
managing inputs and outputs between modules.

**Pulsar Workflows**:
- For processing flows, Pulsar accepts the output of a processing module
  and queues it for input to the next subscribed module.
- For services such as LLMs and embeddings, Pulsar provides a client/server
  model.  A Pulsar queue is used as the input to the service.  When
  processed, the output is then delivered to a separate queue where a client
  subscriber can request that output.

The entire architecture, the pub/sub backbone and set of modules, is bundled into a single Python package. A container image with the
package installed can also run the entire architecture.

## Core Modules

- `chunker-recursive` - Accepts text documents and uses LangChain recursive
  chunking algorithm to produce smaller text chunks.
- `embeddings-hf` - A service which analyses text and returns a vector
  embedding using one of the HuggingFace embeddings models.
- `embeddings-ollama` - A service which analyses text and returns a vector
  embedding using an Ollama embeddings model.
- `embeddings-vectorize` - Uses an embeddings service to get a vector
  embedding which is added to the processor payload.
- `graph-rag` - A query service which applies a Graph RAG algorithm to
  provide a response to a text prompt.
- `triples-write-cassandra` - Takes knowledge graph edges and writes them to
  a Cassandra store.
- `kg-extract-definitions` - knowledge extractor - examines text and
  produces graph edges.
  describing discovered terms and also their defintions.  Definitions are
  derived using the input  documents.
- `kg-extract-relationships` - knowledge extractor - examines text and
  produces graph edges describing the relationships between discovered
  terms.
- `loader` - Takes a document and loads into the processing pipeline.  Used
  e.g. to add PDF documents.
- `pdf-decoder` - Takes a PDF doc and emits text extracted from the document.
  Text extraction from PDF is not a perfect science as PDF is a printable
  format.  For instance, the wrapping of text between lines in a PDF document
  is not semantically encoded, so the decoder will see wrapped lines as
  space-separated.
- `ge-write-milvus` - Takes graph embeddings mappings and records them
  in the vector embeddings store.

## LM Specific Modules

- `text-completion-azure` - Sends request to AzureAI serverless endpoint
- `text-completion-claude` - Sends request to Anthropic's API
- `text-completion-ollama` -  Sends request to LM running using Ollama
- `text-completion-vertexai` -  Sends request to model available through VertexAI API
