# scenarioxp

`scenarioxp` is a toolkit which implements various strategies for sampling concrete parameters from logical scenarios with parameter ranges which is scalable to any number of dimensions. This module extends our other toolkit `sim_bug_tools`, exploiting it's utility in a way that is intuitive and effective while conforming to common datascience data structures of Python.

This module is developed for research in scenario-based testing for the validation and verification (V&V) of autonomous vehicles (AV). We were frustrated by the limitations imposed by time and resource cost of the AV V&V testing process given the many configurations of parameters for AV Testing. This module contains the tools we use to understand and navigate these high-dimensional spaces.
