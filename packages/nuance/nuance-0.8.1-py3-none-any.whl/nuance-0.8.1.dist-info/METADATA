# nuance
Efficient detection of planets transiting quiet or active stars

*nuance* uses linear models and Gaussian processes (using the [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax)-based [tinygp](https://github.com/dfm/tinygp)) to simultaneously **search for planetary transits while modeling correlated noises** (e.g. stellar variability) in a tractable way. See [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06835) for more details.

When to use *nuance*?
- To detect single or periodic transits
- When correlated noises are present in the data (e.g. stellar variability or instrumental systematics)
- For space-based or sparse ground-based observations
- To effectively find transits in light curves from multiple instruments
- To use GPUs for fast transit searches

## Example

```python
import numpy as np
from nuance import linear_search, periodic_search, core

# linear search
epochs = time.copy()
durations = np.linspace(0.01, 0.2, 15)
ls = linear_search(time, flux, gp=gp)(epochs, durations)

# periodic search
periods = np.linspace(0.3, 5, 2000)
snr_function = jax.jit(core.snr(time, flux, gp=gp))
ps_function = periodic_search(epochs, durations, ls, snr_function)
snr, params = ps_function(periods)

t0, D, P = params[np.argmax(snr)]
```
