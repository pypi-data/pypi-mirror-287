class Environment:
    """
    A crab environment for language model agent interaction and evaluation.

    This class supports action execution and observation within a simulated or actual
    ecosystem. The environment is defined by customizable action and observation spaces,
    comprising various crab actions. Actions should include comprehensive docstrings to
    facilitate agent understanding and interaction.

    Typically, users instantiate this class directly to perform actions within the local
    execution context (i.e., the device running the crab framework). This class may also
    serve as a base for specialized environments requiring unique action execution
    processes, such as forwarding actions to remote systems for execution. This is
    achieved by overriding the `take_action` method.

    Actions defined in the `action_space`, `observation_space`, or `reset`, as well as
    those invoked through the `take_action` method that include an `env` parameter, will
    have this parameter automatically populated with the current environment instance.
    This allows actions to access and manipulate environment states and variables.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the environment.
        description (str): A description of the environment.
        trajectory (List[tuple[str, dict[str, Any], Any]]): A record of actions taken,
            their parameters, and the results.

    Args:
        name (str): The name of the environment.
        action_space (List[Action]): A list of actions that can be executed, defining
            the possible interactions agents can undertake.
        observation_space (List[ClosedAction]): A list of observations defining the
            possible states agents can perceive.
        description (str, optional): A textual description of the environment. Defaults
            to an empty string.
        reset (Action | None, optional): An action to reset the environment to its
            initial state. Defaults to `None`.
        remote_url (Action | None, optional): If set, the action will be taken at
            remote machine, by default it will be taken at local. Example:
            `http://192.168.1.1:8000`. Defaults to `None`.
