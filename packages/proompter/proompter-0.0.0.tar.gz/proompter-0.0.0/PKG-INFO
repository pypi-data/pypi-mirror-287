# Proompter

Proompter

Wrapper for llm calls, meant for experimentation with different prompt and history 
handling strategies.

```python
import os
import sys
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv("../../.local.env")
sys.path.append('../')
from proompter import Proompter
```


```python
llm_handler = Proompter(
  llm_h_params = {
    'model_name' : 'llama3',
    'connection_string' : 'http://localhost:11434',
    'kwargs' : {}
  },
  prompt_h_params = {
    'template' : {
        "system" : "{content}",
        #"assistant" : "{content}",
        "user" : "{content}"
    }
  },
  call_strategy_h_params = {
    'strategy_name' : "most_common_output_of_3",
    'strategy_params' : { 'n_calls' : 3}
  },
  tokenizer_h_params = {
    'access_token' : os.getenv("HF_ACCESS_TOKEN"),
    'tokenizer_name' :"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B"
  }

)
```

    The token has not been saved to the git credentials helper. Pass `add_to_git_credential=True` in this function directly or `--add-to-git-credential` if using via `huggingface-cli` if you want to set the git credential as well.
    Token is valid (permission: read).
    Your token has been saved to /home/kyriosskia/.cache/huggingface/token

These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light.\n3. **Scattering**: As the light interacts with these molecules, it scatters in all directions. This scattering is more pronounced for shorter wavelengths, like blue and violet light, which have a higher energy level than longer wavelengths, like red and orange light.\n4. **Blue dominance**: Because blue light is scattered more efficiently by the atmosphere's molecules, it appears to us as the dominant color of the sky during the daytime. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century.\n\nOther factors can influence the apparent color of the sky:\n\n* **Dust and water vapor**: Tiny particles in the atmosphere, like dust, smoke, and water droplets, can scatter light in different ways, making the sky appear more hazy or gray.\n* **Sun position**: The angle at which sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere also affects its perceived color. During sunrise and sunset, when the sun is lower on the horizon, longer wavelengths of light (like red and orange) are able to reach our eyes, giving the sky a more reddish hue.\n* **Atmospheric conditions**: Weather conditions like pollution, cloud cover, or severe weather events can alter the apparent color of the sky.\n\nIn summary, the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in the atmosphere, which favors shorter wavelengths like blue light."},

    Color is the property of an object that is perceived by the human eye and brain as a result of the way it reflects or emits light, causing it to appear red, blue, green, yellow, or any other hue.
