        """Function that processes lines of a track segment from ISR to achieve the following:

            - lines and their coordinates sorted from operational point at the start of the track segment to the operational point at the end
            - smoothed lines (due to errors in line coordinates, too hard angles, ect.)
            - redundant lines removed
            - redundant points (line coordinates) removed
            - merge lines to rails

        This is done such that each track segment (represented by "lines") is then a composition of three possible segments:

            A1. A set of two parallel rails (direction track and opposite track) with open ends (rails do not meet)
            A2. A set of two parallel rails (direction track and opposite track) closed at one end (rails meet at start or end)
            B. A monorail (both directions)

        It is to note that lines of type A1 are never connected geometrically to the other types at transitions. For example, a monorail always starts at the middle point of two parallel rails at a transition, resulting in a gap in the geometry. The reason the ISR stores the rail coordinates like this is assumingly, that monorails near stations are used to topologically connect rails with stations, where transitions to other rails are registered. This way, not all junctions and station rails need to be represented geometrically.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lines: list[LineString]
            A list of LineString objects that represent a track segment. These must be the raw coordinates as received from the ISR converted to LineStrings.

        The function recursively sorts the elements in 'lines', starting with the line closest to 'op_from'. If a line has a parallel line, that will be choosen next in order. Otherwise, next line will be the one with lowest cost assigned.

Here, gap refers to the distance between previous line's end point and canditate line's start point. Likewise, angle refers to the (smallest) angle between the previous line's last segment and candidate line's first segment.

        """Recursive function that identifies connected LineString objects and returns them as merge groups.

        This function recursively identifies connected LineString objects based on various criteria, such as distance between endpoints, angle between lines, and orthogonal distance. It returns these connected lines as merge groups, where each group is represented as a list of line indices.

        The function uses thresholds for distance, angle, and orthogonal distance between lines to determine connections. It also handles specific cases, including circular tracks. Thresholds are emperically determined and do not work for all cases, wherefore some special scenarios are considered when merging kilometer line segments.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lines: list[LineString]
            List of LineString objects.
        merge_km_line: bool
            If true, considers some special cases unique to merging km line segments. TODO: Param + special case could be removed: compute middle line for parallel lines with uneven starting points (and not choose one line as km_line)

        Returns
        -------
        merge_groups_index: list[list[int]]
            List containing n sublists, where n is the number of elements in 'lines'. Each sublist is an index of connected lines.

        Note
        ----

            - Assumes list 'lines' is ordered ( lines: [LineString closest to self.operational_point_from, ..., LineString closest to self.operational_point_to] ).
            - Assumes coordinates of LineStrings in 'lines' to be sorted ( LineString.coords: [Point closest to self.operational_point_from, ..., Point closest to self.operational_point_to])

        Estimates GNSS noise / error for each observation in 'self.gnss'.

        GNSS error is computed as error = sqrt( error_lateral**2 + error_forward**2 ), where lateral and along-track (forward) error are approximated.

        Lateral error is estimated by projecting observations onto their nearest rail. This underestimates the lateral error, as the nearest rail is not necessarily the correct rail.

        Forward error is estimated as the difference between the distance bewteen two observations along the track, and the distance based on velocity and time of both measurements. If the gnss series does not contain velocity measurements, the forward error is sampled from a set distribution.

        GNSS noise is estimated from total errors using either standard deviation (method='std') or median absolute deviation (method='mad'). Generally, the estimate using 'std' is higher, as 'mad' is more robust to outliers.

        Identifies bi-directional rails and sets their attribute 'direction' to 0.

        This method only considers directed rails, as monorails always are set to be bi-directional. Directed rails are set to bi-directional rails, if they belong to a rail sequence between type B transitions (eg. <==-=>).

        To identify bi-directional rail sequences, first type B transitions are identified by counting the number of points at rail ends, as type B transitions have 2 overlapping points due to rails joining at rail start/end. To identify rails between, for each bi-directional rail that end of the rail that is nor part of the type B transition, is added to list of points, thus creating a second start/end point for that rail. In a second iteration, those rails inbetween are then also identified.
