## About

Have you ever needed to install a brand new Linux distro or BSD system? Any
experient user has done this at least a couple times, and certainly has a
dotfiles repository somewhere. But how would you transfer your dotfiles? Maybe
with symbolic links, copying files from a cloned repository, flash drive or
perhaps a combination of those.

With Bare Estate you don't need a convoluted strategy for managing your
dotfiles. You can create a bare repository that will store your repository's
data. Manage your dotfiles as if they were on a regular repo. Even files from
your home directory, without actually turning your home into a git repository
itself.

And the best part is the application handles the abstraction for you,
so you can use it in the same you use git!

## Install

To install this package from the PyPI, you can use the command:

```sh
pip install -U bare-estate
```
