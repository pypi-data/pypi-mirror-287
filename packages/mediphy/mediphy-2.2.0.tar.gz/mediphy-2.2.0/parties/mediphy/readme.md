## Trends Saving
### save export
This saves the collections as .export files, sort of like JSON.  
	
```	
[@ mediphy_1]
mediphy trends saves exports-export --version 1
```

### import export-import-overwrite
This deletes the collections, and then imports the save.  

```
[@ mediphy_1]
mediphy trends saves exports-import-overwrite --version 1
```

### import export-import-merge
This merges the save into the current collection.  
	
```
[@ mediphy_1]
mediphy trends saves exports-import-overwrite --version 
```
