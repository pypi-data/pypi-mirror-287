## Installation

### Using the Makefile

1. **Clone the repository**:

     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     cd <repository-name>
     ```

2. **Run the setup command**:

The Makefile provides a convenient way to set up the project. Run the following command to install dependencies and set up the environment:

     ```bash
     make setup
     ```

     This command will:

     - Install dependencies using poetry.
     - Set up the virtual environment.
     - Install project-specific dependencies.

     If you prefer to set up the environment manually, please refer to the manual setup instructions in the original README.

## Usage

### Setting Up

Configure AWS: Create a config.yaml file in the root directory with the following structure:

```yaml
aws:
    region: your-aws-region
    bucket_name: your-s3-bucket-name
    bucket_privacy: private # or public-read
```

Set the commands file location (optional):

```bash
cmd_stash set-location <path-to-commands-file>
```

### Commands

Save a command:

```bash
cmd_stash save <category> <subcategory> <description> <command>
```

List commands:

```bash
cmd_stash list <category> [--subcategory <subcategory>] [--description <description>]
```

Export commands to a file:

```bash
cmd_stash export <file-path>
```

Import commands from a file:

```bash
cmd_stash import <file-path>
```

Create an S3 bucket:

```bash
cmd_stash create-bucket
```

Upload commands to S3:

```bash

```

Download commands from S3:

```bash
