# arctemplates


These are wavelength calibrated spectra of arc lamps, to be used in automated wavelength identification and calibration (e.g. with Dynamic Time Warping). These might be general emission lamp spectra, or those taken for specific instruments at specific slit or grating modes (e.g. the Kosmos files, [developed here](https://github.com/jradavenport/kosmos-arc)).
