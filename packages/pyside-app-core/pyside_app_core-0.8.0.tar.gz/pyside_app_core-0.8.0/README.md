```


## Local Development

Requirements:
- Hatch ([installation instructions](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/))

### Generate resources files

Resource files MUST be generated at least once in the project using this library 
for icons to function.

When installed this library provides a cli tool `pyside-app-core-compile-rcc` 
that aids in generating a `resources.rcc` file.

```shell
# from repo with this lib installed
pyside-app-core-compile-rcc a/target/directory
```
