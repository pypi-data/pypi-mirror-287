# Google Scholar Citation World Map

[Chen Liu](https://www.chenliu1996.com/), CS PhD Candidate (Machine Learning, MedicalVision, AI4Science) at Yale University.

## Purpose
This is a simple Python tool to generate a HTML citation world map from your Google Scholar ID.

It is easy to install (`pip install citation-map`, available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/citation-map/)) and easy to use (see the [Usage](https://github.com/ChenLiu-1996/CitationMap?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) section).

## Warning
1. This script is a bit slow. On my personal computer, it takes half a minute to process each citation. If you have thousands of citations, it may or may not be a good idea to use this script.
2. I tried to use multiprocessing, but unfortunately the excessive visits get me blocked by Google Scholar.

## Expected Outcome
You will be given an HTML file as the output of the script. If you open it on a browser, you will see your own version of the following citation world map.

## Usage
1. Install the package.
    ```
    pip install citation-map
    ```

2. Find your Google Scholar ID.

    - Open your Google Scholar profile. The URL should take the form of `https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID`. In this case, your Google Scholar ID is just the string `GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID`.
    - Please kindly ignore configuration strings such as `&hl=en` (host language is English) or `&sortby=pubdate` (sort the works by date of publication).

3. In an empty Python script (for example, [the demo script](https://github.com/ChenLiu-1996/CitationMap/blob/main/demo/demo.py)), run the following.
    ```
    from citation_map import generate_citation_map

    # This is my Google Scholar ID. Replace this with your ID.
    scholar_id = "3rDjnykAAAAJ"
    generate_citation_map(scholar_id)
    ```

    You can take a look at additional input arguments of the function `generate_citation_map` (listed below) in case you need those functionalities.

    ```
    Parameters
    ----
    scholar_id: str
        Your Google Scholar ID.
    use_proxy: bool
        If true, we will use a scholarly proxy.
        It is necessary for some environments to avoid blocks, but it usually makes things slower.
    pin_colorful: bool
        If true, the location pins will have a variety of colors.
        Otherwise, it will only have one color.
    output_path: str
        The path to the output HTML file.
    ```
