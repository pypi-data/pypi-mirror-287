## Purpose
This is a simple Python tool to generate an HTML citation world map from your Google Scholar ID.

It is easy to install (`pip install citation-map`, available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/citation-map/)) and easy to use (see the [Usage](https://github.com/ChenLiu-1996/CitationMap?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) section).

**You don't need to fork this repo unless you want to make custom changes.**

## Expected Outcome
You will be given an HTML file as the output of the script.

If you open it on a browser, you will see your own version of the following citation world map.

## Usage
1. Install the package.
    ```
    pip install citation-map
    ```
    Remember to upgrade to the latest version if you installed an earlier version.
    ```
    pip install citation-map --upgrade
    ```

2. Find your Google Scholar ID.

    - Open your Google Scholar profile. The URL should take the form of `https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID`. In this case, your Google Scholar ID is just the string `GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID`.
    - Please kindly ignore configuration strings such as `&hl=en` (host language is English) or `&sortby=pubdate` (sort the works by date of publication).

3. In an empty Python script (for example, [the demo script](https://github.com/ChenLiu-1996/CitationMap/blob/main/demo/demo.py)), run the following.
    ```
    from citation_map import generate_citation_map

    # This is my Google Scholar ID. Replace this with your ID.
    scholar_id = '3rDjnykAAAAJ'
    generate_citation_map(scholar_id)
    ```

    You can take a look at the input arguments (listed below) of the function `generate_citation_map` in case you need those functionalities.

    ```
    Parameters
    ----
    scholar_id: str
        Your Google Scholar ID.
    output_path: str
        (default is 'citation_map.html')
        The path to the output HTML file.
    num_processes: int
        (default is 16)
        Number of separate processes for parallel processing.
    use_proxy: bool
        (default is False)
        If true, we will use a scholarly proxy.
        It is necessary for some environments to avoid blocks, but it usually makes things slower.
    pin_colorful: bool
        (default is True)
        If true, the location pins will have a variety of colors.
        Otherwise, it will only have one color.
    print_citing_institutions: bool
        (default is True)
        If true, print the list of citing institutions (affiliations of citing authors).
    ```

## Debug
1. `scholarly._proxy_generator.MaxTriesExceededException`

    - From my experience, this is a good indicator that your IP address is blocked by Google Scholar due to excessive or frequent crawling (using the `scholarly` package).
    - One hot fix I found was to hop on a University VPN and run again. I typically experience this error after running the tool twice, and I need to disconnect and reconnect my VPN to "unblock" myself.
    - In case changing your IP address does not help, you can try to reduce the number of processes (e.g., setting `num_processes=1`).

## Changelog

### Version 3.0
I realized a problem with how I used `geopy.geocoders`. A majority of the authors' self-entered affiliations are not successfully found in the system and hence are not converted to geographic coordinates on the world map. For example, the string "Yale University" is a much better entry than "Assistant Professor at Yale University".

I applied a simple fix with some rule-based language processing. This helps us identify many missing citing locations.

### Version 2.0
I finally managed to **drastically speed up** the process using multiprocessing, in a way that avoids being blocked by Google Scholar.

On my personal computer, processing my profile with 100 citations took 1 hour with version 1.0 while it's now taking 5 minutes with version 2.0.

With that said, please be careful and do not run this tool frequently. I can easily get on Google Scholar's blacklist after a few runs.

### Version 1.0
Very basic functionality.

This script is a bit slow. On my personal computer, it takes half a minute to process each citation. If you have thousands of citations, it may or may not be a good idea to use this script.

I tried to use multiprocessing, but unfortunately the excessive visits get me blocked by Google Scholar.

## Dependencies
Dependencies (`scholarly`, `geopy`, `folium`, `tqdm`) are already taken care of when you install via pip.

## Acknowledgements
This script was written under the assistance of ChatGPT-4o, but of course after intense debugging.
