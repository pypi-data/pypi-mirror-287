'''
Provides a `TimeBasedEventExecutor` that can be iterativley updated with the current "time".

If any "events" should have taken place between the last given time and the current time, they will be triggered.

Events are specified as 2- or 3-tuples. 
    - The first item in each tuple is the time when the event takes place.
    - The second is a function to call when the event is triggered,
    - The third item (optional) is a message string to be printed after the event function is executed.

ToDo:
    Get rid of any instances of 3-tuples, message printing should just be done in the event functions...(looking at you VertexTissue.SG)

def TimeBasedEventExecutor(events):
    '''Execute events after specific "times" have passed.

    Args:
        Events: List of 2- or 3- tuples. First item in each tuple is the time for each event, second item is the function to be executed for each event,
             third item (optional) is a string to be printed after the event function is executed.

    Returns:
        wait_and_excute: Function that can be called with signature wait_and_execute(t, *args), where `t` is the current "time" and `*args` are any argument
            to be passed to the event function(s). This function also has `extend` and `append` methods that allow for the event list to be grown using the same
            syntax as lists.

    ToDo:
        Add method to query the time until the next event.
