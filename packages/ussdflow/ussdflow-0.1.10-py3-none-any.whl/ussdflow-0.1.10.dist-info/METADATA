## Key Features

- Dynamic Menu Creation: Easily define and manage USSD menus with dynamic content and options.
- Seamless Integration: Integrates directly with Africa's Talking USSD gateway for reliable and scalable USSD services.
- Efficient Caching: Leverages Redis for high-performance caching, ensuring quick and efficient session management.
- User Session Management: Handles user sessions effectively, tracking user progress through the USSD menus.
- Flexible Configuration: Offers flexible configuration options to tailor the USSD experience to specific needs.
- Error Handling: Robust error handling ensures smooth user interactions even when issues arise.

Installation
To install UssdFlow, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install ussdflow
```

## Getting Started

Here’s a quick example to get you started with UssdFlow:

```python
from ussdflow import CacheManager, IngressData, USSDService

# Initialize the cache manager

cache_manager = CacheManager(cache_type="redis", host="localhost", port=6379)

# Initialize the USSD service

ussd_service = USSDService(
    menu_file_path="path/to/your/menu.json",
    cache_manager=cache_manager
)

# Sample USSD request

request = IngressData(
    session_id="1234",
    service_code="*123#",
    phone_number="254712345678",
    text=""
)

# Process the request

response = ussd_service.ingress(request)
print(response)
```
