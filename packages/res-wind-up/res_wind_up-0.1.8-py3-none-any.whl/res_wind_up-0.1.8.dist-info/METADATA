## Getting Started
See [`examples`](examples) folder for example analysis using the wind-up package. [`smarteole_example.ipynb`](examples%2Fsmarteole_example.ipynb) is a good place to start.

The wind-up package can be installed in a virtual environment with the following commands:
```shell
# create and activate a virtual environment, if needed
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate  # or .venv/bin/activate on linux or ".venv/Scripts/activate" in Windows command prompt
# install the wind-up package in the virtual environment
pip install res-wind-up # alternatively clone the repo, navigate to the wind-up folder and run "pip install ."
```
Note that the package is named `wind_up` (with an underscore) in Python code. For example to print the version of the installed package use the following code snippet:
```python
import wind_up
print(wind_up.__version__)
```

## Contributing
To start making changes fork the repository or make a new branch from `main`. Note `main` is protected; 
if a commit fails to push and you want to undo it try `git reset origin/main --hard`

After cloning the repository (and creating and activating the virtual environment), use the following commands to install the wind-up package in editable mode with the dev dependencies:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/resgroup/wind-up # or your fork of wind-up
cd wind-up
# create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate  # or .venv/bin/activate on linux or ".venv/Scripts/activate" in Windows command prompt
# install the package in editable mode with the dev dependencies
pip install -e .[dev] # or .[jupyter,dev] if you want jupyter dependencies as well
```
Use `poe all` to run all required pre-push commands (make sure the virtual environment is activated)

## Running tests
Install dev dependencies and use `poe test` to run unit tests (make sure the virtual environment is activated)
