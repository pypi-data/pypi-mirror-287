## Usage

### `worktoy.desc`

#### Background

The descriptor protocol in Python allows significant customization of the
attribute access mechanism. To understand this protocol, consider a class
body assigning an object to a name. During the class creation process,
when this line is reached, the object is assigned to the name. For the
purposes of this discussion, the object is created when this line is
reached, for example:

```python
class PlanePoint:
  """This class represent an integer valued point in the plane. """
  x = Integer(0)
  y = Integer(0)  # Integer is defined below. In practice, classes should 
  #  be defined in dedicated files.
``` 

The above class ´PlanePoint´ owns a pair of attributes. These are
instances of the ´Integer´ class defined below. The ´Integer´ class is a
descriptor and is thus the focus of this discussion.

```python
class Integer:
  """This descriptor class wraps an integer value. More details will be 
  added throughout this discussion."""
  __fallback_value__ = 0
  __default_value__ = None
  __field_name__ = None
  __field_owner__ = None

  def __init__(self, *args) -> None:
    for arg in args:
      if isinstance(arg, int):
        self.__default_value__ = arg
        break
    else:  # See explanation below for the unusual for-else statement.
      self.__default_value__ = self.__fallback_value__

  def __set_name__(self, owner: type, name: str) -> None:
    """Powerful method called automatically when the class owning the 
    descriptor instance is finally created. It informs the descriptor 
    instance of its owner and importantly, it informs the descriptor of 
    the name by which it appears in the class body. """
    self.__field_name__ = name
    self.__field_owner__ = owner

  def __get__(self, instance: object, owner: type) -> int:
    """Getter-function."""

```

#### Unusual `for-else` statement

The code above features the unusual and under-appreciated for-else
statement in the `__init__` method. If the for loop terminates by the ´break´
keyword, the ´else´ block is skipped. If the for loop completes without
hitting the ´break´ keyword, the ´else´ block is executed. As used here,
the for loop tries to find an integer from the received positional
arguments. If it finds one, it assigns it and hits the ´break´ keyword
and the ´else´ block is skipped. If unable to find an integer, the for
loop will terminate normally, and the ´else´ block will execute, where
the fallback value is conveniently waiting to be assigned.

#### The `__set_name__` method

This method is a powerful addition to the descriptor protocol. To
understand its significance, consider that the descriptor class was
instantiated in the class body, during creation of the owning class,
but before the owning class was actually created. When the owning class
is created, every instance of a class that implements this method,
that was assigned to a name in the class body of the newly created
class, will have this method called with the owning class and the
name at which the instance appears in the class body.

#### The `__get__` method

This method is called in two different situations that differ
substantially. When the descriptor is accessed through the owning
class and when the descriptor is accessed through an instance of the
owning class. This distinction may be likened to that of accessing a
method. Accessing a method through its owning class returns an
unbound method. In contrast, accessing a method through an instance
of the class returns a method bound to this instance. This is why the
first argument of a method is ´self´ (except for ´classmethods´ and
´staticmethods´).

If the instance is None, it signifies that the descriptor is being
accessed through the owning class. In this case, it is the opinion of
this author that the descriptor should always return itself. This allows
other objects to access the descriptor object itself, instead of the
value it wraps. Choosing this return value also follows the pattern
used by methods. Nevertheless, descriptor classes are allowed to
return any object when accessed through the owning class.

This brings the discussion to the central situation allowing significant
customization of what it even means for a Python class to have an
attribute. This part of the discussion will explain some typical uses
before describing the novel use case provided by the ´AttriBox´ class,
which is the central feature of the ´worktoy.desc´ module.

#### Property-like behaviour

A common implementation of the descriptor protocol makes use of a
'private' attribute owned by the instance. Python does not enforce 'private'
attributes, but the convention is to denote attributes intended to remain
'private' with a leading underscore. While convention only, IDEs and
linters will commonly mark as warning or even an error when this
convention is not observed. It is the opinion of this author that issues
caused by failure to observe this convention does not merit fixing, with
the sole exception being security related issues.

Below is an example using a descriptor class to expose a 'private'
attribute through dedicated accessor functions.

```python

class SpacePoint:
  """This class represent an integer valued point in the plane. """
  _x = None
  _y = None
  x = Float(0.)
  y = Float(0.)
```   

Like before, it is the descriptor class more so that the owner class that
is the subject of this discussion:

```python
class Float:
  """Descriptor class wrapping a floating point value"""
  __field_name__ = None
  __field_owner__ = None
  __fallback_value__ = 0.0
  __default_value__ = None

  def __init__(self, *args, ) -> None:
    for arg in args:
      if isinstance(arg, float):
        self.__default_value__ = arg
        break
    else:  # See explanation below for the unusual for-else statement.
      self.__default_value__ = self.__fallback_value__

  def __set_name__(self, owner: type, name: str) -> None:
    self.__field_name__ = name
    self.__field_owner__ = owner

  def _getPrivateName(self) -> str:
    """This 'private' method formats the name at which instances of this 
    descriptor class will expect 'private' attributes. """
    if self.__field_name__ is None:
      e = """Unable to format private name, before owning class is 
      created!"""
      raise RuntimeError(e)
    if isinstance(self.__field_name__, str):
      return """_%s""" % self.__field_name__
    e = """Expected field name to be instance of str, but received '%s' 
    of class '%s'!"""
    fieldName = self.__field_name__
    typeName = type(fieldName).__name__
    raise TypeError(e % (fieldName, typeName))

  def __get__(self, instance: object, owner: type, **kwargs) -> object:
    """Getter-function. If instance is None, the descriptor instance 
    returns itself. Otherwise, the descriptor attempts to find a value at 
    the expected private name. If no value is present, the default value 
    of the descriptor is assigned to the expected private name and the 
    getter function is called recursively again. This pattern ensures 
    that if the descriptor lacks permission or is otherwise unable to 
    assign values to owning instances, an error is raised immediately. """
    if instance is None:
      return self
    pvtName = self._getPrivateName()
    if getattr(instance, pvtName, None) is not None:
      return getattr(instance, pvtName)
    if kwargs.get('_recursion', False):
      raise RecursionError
    setattr(instance, pvtName, self.__default_value__)
    return self.__get__(instance, owner, _recursion=True)

  def __set__(self, instance: object, value: object) -> None:
    """Setter-function. Although not provided in this example, setter 
    functions provide a convenient place to enforce constraints, in 
    particular type guarding as well as casting and validation. """
    pvtName = self._getPrivateName()
    setattr(instance, pvtName, value)

  def __delete__(self, instance: object) -> None:
    """IMPORTANT! This method is what is called when the 'del' keyword is 
    used on an attribute through an instance. This method is NOT the same 
    as __del__. This latter method is called when the object itself is 
    deleted. Regarding that particular method, this author finds occasion 
    to mention never having observed it implemented in the wild. """
    pvtName = self._getPrivateName()
    if hasattr(instance, pvtName):
      return delattr(instance, pvtName)
    e = """Instance of class '%s' does not have attribute '%s'!"""
    raise AttributeError(e % (instance.__class__.__name__, pvtName))
```

The above describes a common pattern of using the descriptor protocol to
expose 'private' attributes through dedicated accessor functions. The
above is a very straightforward example, but the descriptor protocol is
capable of much more!

#### The `property` class

It is likely that some readers are familiar with the `property` class.
Where we are going we do not need the `property` class! Nevertheless, let
us now see a descriptor class that implements the behaviour of the
property class. The property class may seem like advanced or
sophisticated, but as this discussion progresses, the mundane and simple
nature of it will reveal itself.

To avoid confusion, this implementation will be named `Field` as the
name ``property`` is already taken.

```python
class Field:
  """Descriptor class wrapping a value"""
  __field_name__ = None
  __field_owner__ = None
  __default_value__ = None
  __getter_function__ = None
  __setter_function__ = None
  __deleter_function__ = None

  def __init__(self, *args) -> None:
    if args:
      self.__default_value__ = args[0]

  def __set_name__(self, owner: type, name: str) -> None:
    self.__field_name__ = name
    self.__field_owner__ = owner

  def _getGetterFunction(self, ) -> Callable:
    """This 'private' method returns the getter-function. This must be
      explicitly defined by the GET decorator for the descriptor to 
      implement getting. This allows significant customization of the 
      attribute access mechanism. """
    if self.__getter_function__ is None:
      e = """The getter-function must be explicitly set by the SET 
      decorator!"""
      raise AttributeError(e)
    if callable(self.__getter_function__):
      return self.__getter_function__
    e = """Expected getter-function to be callable, but received '%s'
        of class '%s'!"""
    func = self.__getter_function__
    typeName = type(func).__name__
    raise TypeError(e % (func, typeName))

  def _getSetterFunction(self, ) -> Callable:
    """This 'private' method returns the setter-function. This must be 
    explicitly defined by the SET decorator for the descriptor to 
    implement setting. Please note, that the setter-function is by no 
    means required and in particular when the descriptor is used to 
    provide a readonly attribute, the setter-function should remain 
    undefined or even defined as a Callable raising an exception. If so, 
    this author suggests raising a TypeError to indicate that this is a 
    readonly object. Alternatively, raising an AttributeError is also 
    observed, although such an error indicates that the instance is not 
    presently capable of supporting this attribute. Not that the object 
    is entirely incapable of supporting setting the attribute. """

Having implemented the `Field` class, some readers will certainly
recognize its use as identical, more or less, to that of the `property`.
One exception to note however is that instances of ``Field`` should be
defined at the top of the class body, unlike the `property` class.

```python
class Server:
  """This example class uses instances of the Field class to define the 
  address and port attributes typically used in server classes. """

  __fallback_address__ = 'localhost'
  __fallback_port__ = 12345

  __private_address__ = None
  __private_port__ = None

  address = Field()
  port = Field()

  @address.GET
  def _getAddress(self, ) -> str:
    """Getter-function responsible for returning the address."""
    if self.__private_address__ is None:
      return self.__fallback_address__
    return self.__private_address__

  @address.SET
  def _setAddress(self, value: str) -> None:
    """Setter-function responsible for setting the address."""
    self.__private_address__ = value

  @address.DELETE
  def _deleteAddress(self, ) -> Never:
    """For the sake of example, let us disable the deleter-function to 
    illustrate how the accessor provide a convenient protection against 
    inadvertent deletion of attributes. Please note the use of the 
    'Never' type hint. This is meant to indicate that this method will 
    never return. Once this method is invoked, the program will certainly 
    raise an exception. """
    e = """The address attribute is read-only!"""
    raise TypeError(e)

  @port.GET
  def _getPort(self) -> int:
    """Getter-function responsible for returning the port."""
    if self.__private_port__ is None:
      return self.__fallback_port__
    return self.__private_port__

  @port.SET
  def _setPort(self, port: int) -> None:
    """Setter-function responsible for setting the port."""
    self.__private_port__ = port

  @port.DELETE
  def _delPort(self, ) -> Never:
    """Disabled deleter-function for the port attribute. The same as for 
    the address attribute."""
    e = """The port attribute is read-only!"""
    raise TypeError(e)
```

The above ``Server`` class does have an unfortunate boilerplate to
functionality ratio. Hopefully it provides a helpful illustration of the
descriptor protocol. While implementing all methods of the descriptor
protocol, the ``Field`` class could be further enhanced by implementing
strong type checking or even casting. This is left as an exercise for
those readers who have read the guidelines in the contribution section.

#### The `AttriBox` class - Prologue

This class is the central feature of the `worktoy.desc` module. It is the
logical next step of the implementations hitherto discussed. Before
diving into the implementation, let us begin with a use case.

#### PySide6 - Qt for Python

The PySide6 library provides Python bindings for the Qt framework. What
is Qt? For the purposes of this discussion, Qt is a framework for
developing professional and high-quality graphical user interfaces.
Entirely with Python. Below is a very simple script that opens an empty
window and nothing more.

```python
import sys
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow
from PySide6.QtCore import QSize


class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
  def __init__(self, parent=None):
    super().__init__(parent)
    self.setWindowTitle("Hello, World!")
    self.setMinimumSize(QSize(480, 320))


if __name__ == "__main__":
  app = QApplication(sys.argv)
  window = MainWindow()
  window.show()
  sys.exit(app.exec())
```

From here, the window class can be extended to include buttons, text boxes,
and other widgets. Qt provides off-the-shelf widgets for much common use.
These widgets may be subclassed further customizing their appearance or
behaviour. Actually advanced users may even create entirely new widgets
from the ground up. The possibilities are endless.

Before we get carried away, we need to keep one very important quirk in
mind. Qt provides a vast array of classes that all inherit from the
`QObject` class. This class has an odd, but very unforgiving requirement.
No instances of `QObject` may be instantiated without a running
QCoreApplication. This immediately presents a problem to our otherwise
elegant descriptor protocol: We are not permitted to instantiate
instances before the main script runs. Such as during class creation. For
this reason, the `AttriBox` class was created to implement lazy
instantiation! Let us now see how we might create a more advanced
graphical user interface whilst adhering to the `QObject` requirement.

#### The `AttriBox` class - Lazy instantiation
 
```python
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QWidget
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout, QLabel
from PySide6.QtCore import QSize

from worktoy.desc import AttriBox, THIS


class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
  """Subclass of QMainWindow. This class provides the main window for the 
  application. """

  baseWidget = AttriBox[QWidget](THIS)
  verticalLayout = AttriBox[QVBoxLayout]()
  welcomeLabel = AttriBox[QLabel]()

  def show(self) -> None:
    """Before invoking the parent method, we will setup the window. """
    self.setMinimumSize(QSize(480, 320))
    self.setWindowTitle("WorkToy!")
    self.welcomeLabel.setText("""Welcome to AttriBox!""")
    self.verticalLayout.addWidget(self.welcomeLabel)
    self.baseWidget.setLayout(self.verticalLayout)
    self.setCentralWidget(self.baseWidget)
    QMainWindow.show(self)


if __name__ == "__main__":
  app = QApplication([])
  window = MainWindow()
  window.show()
  app.exec()

```
