# Pastebinlib
By TheDiamondOG
Source Code: https://github.com/thediamondog/pastebinlib

A small python library made for interacting with Pastebin

## Story
This was one of those small projects I would just make while I am in class, normally I would just make a multi tool, but this time I wanted to add in Pastebin support which is why I made Pastebinlib. It was meant to be for that small project on Replit, but I thought this is a pretty useful tool, so I wanted to make it public on GitHub.

This was originally made on November 13, 2023. The thing is that I forgot to upload it for 4 days so the whole thing released on GitHub on November 13, 2023.

8 months later I got bored and wanted to upgrade the project, so after releasing fake terminal I worked on this. So now Pastebinlib is now better, and I actually know how to get something on PyPi.
