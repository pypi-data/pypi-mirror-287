# Basket

## Introduction

Basket is the essential toolkit for seamless MaaS integration.

It provides a unified interface for interacting with different MaaS services, allowing developers to easily switch between different services without changing their code. It is the first free toolkit that allows developers to use LLM model services without registering or paying for them. Know more about [FreeModel](https://github.com/OrchardUniverse/FreeModel).

- Unified interface for interacting with different MaaS services
