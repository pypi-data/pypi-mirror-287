@gd.watch() # Watches for any exceptions and notifies you
def this_function_will_fail():

    return 42 / 0


this_function_will_fail()
```

## Credentials

To get your `api_key`, `uid` and `service_id` values, [login](https://guardog.app/login) (or [signup](https://guardog.app/signup) if you already haven't) to Guardog

And once you are directed to your dashboard, follow these steps

1. `Create Service`
2. Choose `Application error alerting` in dropdown
3. Fill in the form along with the notification info

And that's it! You are all set to receive alerts everytime your program crashes during runtime.

**Note:**&nbsp; We don't spam you everytime an exception occurs. We only notify you every 6 hours from the last occurence.
