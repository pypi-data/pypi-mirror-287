## About

pygmid is a Python 3 version of the gm/ID starter kit by Prof. Boris Murmann 
of Stanford University. The package also offers some scripts from the Paul Jesper's book.

If you find this package useful for your research, please consider citing it.

The original MATLAB gm/ID starter kit can be found [here](https://github.com/bmurmann/Book-on-gm-ID-design/tree/main/starter_kit)

## Installation

To install pygmid from source, download from Github and run pip:

`pip install .`

 in the root directory.

 pygmid can also be installed from PyPI:

`pip install pygmid`

## Usage

### Scripting with the Lookup Class
A gm/ID lookup object can be generated with the `Lookup` class. The lookup object requires lookup data for initialisation. Both `.mat` files generated using MATLAB or `.pkl` files generated using pygmid's own characterisation script are supported.

You can create a lookup object as follows:

```python
from pygmid import Lookup as lk

NCH = lk('180nch.mat')
```
### Access MOS Data
The `Lookup` class allows for pseudo array access of the MOS matrix data. You can access data as follows:

```python
# get VGS data as array from NCH
VGS_array = NCH['VGS']
```

Data is returned as a deep copy of the array contained in the `Lookup` object.

### Lookup functionality 

Lookup of interpolated data occurs as follows:

```python
VDSs = NCH['VDS'] 
VGSs = np.arange(0.4, 0.6, 0.05)
# Plot ID versus VDS
ID = NCH.look_up('ID', vds=VDSs, vgs=VGSs)
# alias function lookup can also be used
ID = NCH.lookup('ID', vds=VDSs, vgs=VGSs)
# check bias
VGS = NCH.look_upVGS(GM_ID = 10, VDS = 0.6, VSB = 0.1, L = 0.18)
print(f'VGS is: {VGS}')

plt.plot(VDSs, np.transpose(ID))
```

Modes 1 (Simple parameter lookup), mode 2 (arbitrary ratio lookup) and mode 3 (cross lookup of ratios) are implemented. The companion lookupVGS function is also included.

### Technology Extraction Functions

The EKV extraction function can be used as follows:

```python
from pygmid import EKV_param_extraction, XTRACT

(VDS, n, VT, JS, d1n, d1VT, d1logJS, d2n, d2VT, d2logJS)\
        = EKV_param_extraction(NCH, 1, L = 0.18, VDS = 0.6, VSB = 0.0)

```

Sample usage of this and other utility functions can be found in `debug_utility.py` .

### Examples

Usage of lookup scripts are given in `debug_lookup.py` and `debug_lookupVGS.py`.

Sample outputs for the 180nm generic pdk used in the Murmann starter pack are given below:

The generic PDK data is hosted <a href="https://github.com/bmurmann/Book-on-gm-ID-design">here</a>.

### Sweeping a Technology

`pygmid` also features a CLI which can be used to run techweeps to generate transistor data.

*Documentation will be added in due course. This functionality is in a state of flux.*

      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
