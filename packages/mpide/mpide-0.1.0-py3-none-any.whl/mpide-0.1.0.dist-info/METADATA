# ESP32 MicroPython TUI IDE

This project is currently being set up and not intended to be usable by anyone but me.
However `mpide` _runs_ on my machine and might as well run on your's, too.


## Usage

Install:
```
[python3 -m ]pip install [--user] [--upgrade] mpide
``

Execute:
```
mpide
```

Or add `mpide` as dependency to an existing MicroPython project in order to synchronize locally
modified files while `mpide` is running.


## Roadmap

This is what I intend to implement in the near future, since it's what I need in daily live:

- [x] Textual based IDE stub based on `trickkiste/TuiBaseApp`
- [x] Involve `mpremote` to automatically connect to attached (ESP32) devices running MicroPython
- [x] REPL command history
- [x] fix multi-line input
- [ ] allow device / connection speed settings
- [ ] Provide RAM-FS for temporarily patched files and to avoid wearing out your flash
- [x] auto-update mpy/py files on change
- [ ] make auto-update optional
- [ ] Persist temporary files
- [ ] Fix dark-mode
- [ ] bootstrap (i.e. populate a newly flashed device with helper stuff for remote working)
- [ ] auto-reload modules on development host
- [ ] Web-REPL
- [ ] Web-based remote updating
