# GPT Computer Agent
Hi, this is an alternative work for providing ChatGPT MacOS app to Windows and Linux. In this way this is a fresh and stable work. You can easily install as Python library for this time but we will prepare a pipeline for providing native install scripts (.exe).

Powered by <a href="https://github.com/Upsonic/Tiger"><strong>Upsonic Tiger üêÖ</strong></a> A function hub for llm agents.




## Installation and Run
Needed >= Python 3.9
```console
pip3 install 'gpt-computer-agent[base]'
```

```console
computeragent
```

### Wake Word | NEW
<details>


We have added Pvporcupine integration. To use it, you need to install an additional library:

```console
pip3 install 'gpt-computer-agent[wakeword]'
```

After that, please enter your [Pvporcupine](https://picovoice.ai/) API key and enable the wake word feature.

### Agent Infrastructure

With this way you can create `crewai` agents and using it into gpt-computer-agent gui and tools.


```console
pip3 install 'gpt-computer-agent[base]'
pip3 install 'gpt-computer-agent[agentic]'
```

```python
from gpt_computer_agent import Agent, start

manager = Agent(
  role='Project Manager',
  goal='understands project needs and assist coder',
  backstory="""You're a manager at a large company.""",
)

coder = Agent(
  role='Senior Python Coder',
  goal='writing python scripts and copying to clipboard',
  backstory="""You're a python developer at a large company.""",
)


start()
```



### Adding Custom Tools

Now you are able to add custom tools that run in the agentic infra and agent processes. 


```python
from gpt_computer_agent import Tool, start

@Tool
def sum_tool(first_number: int, second_number: int) -> str:
    """Useful for when you need to sum two numbers together."""
    return first_number + second_number

start()
```






### API | NEW

Now you can use your GPT Computer Agent remotely! GUI still active, for this there is few steps:

```console
pip3 install 'gpt-computer-agent[base]'
pip3 install 'gpt-computer-agent[api]'
```

```console
computeragent --api
```


```python
from gpt_computer_agent.remote import remote

output = remote.input("Hi, how are you today?", screen=False, talk=False)
print(output)

remote.just_screenshot()

remote.talk("TTS test")

# Other Functionalities
remote.reset_memory()
remote.profile("default")

remote.enable_predefined_agents()
remote.disable_predefined_agents()

remote.enable_online_tools()
remote.disable_online_tools()
```
