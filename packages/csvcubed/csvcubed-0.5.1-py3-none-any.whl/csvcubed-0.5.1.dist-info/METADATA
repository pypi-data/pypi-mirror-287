# csvcubed

csvcubed project provides a command line tool which make it straightforward to turn a CSV into 5-star linked data (CSV-W)

By publishing 5-star linked data and leveraging open standards for data, we believe that we can help ensure that statistical data is discoverable, comparable and analysable by automated tools. We hope that this standards-based approach will unlock network effects which accelerate data analysis by making it easier to collate, compare and contrast data from different sources.

All our work depends on open standards; however it isn't just for open data. Share your data with the world or keep it private, the choice is yours.

## Getting started immediately

Get going with csvcubed immediately by installing csvcubed using pip.

```bash
pip install csvcubed
```

From there you'll have access to the `csvcubed` command line tool which features sub commands `build` and `inspect` to create CSV-Ws from CSV and inspect CSV-Ws.

Become well acquainted to csvcubed with our [quick start](https://gss-cogs.github.io/csvcubed-docs/external/quick-start/), which includes written instructions as well as transcribed videos.

## User Documentation

csvcubed has extensive user documentation which tracks the release of csvcubed while it is in its beta phase. Our [documentation](https://gss-cogs.github.io/csvcubed-docs/external/) can always be improved, so treat bad docs as a bug report.
