    """
    Calculates the distortion of a given winner in a deterministic voting rule for that setting. Could be average or worst case.
    
    Args:
        winner (int): The identifier of the winning candidate.
        parser (DataParser): An instance of the DataParser class, used to parse and handle the data.
        num_iteres (int, optional): The number of iterations to average over for distortion calculation. Defaults to 1.
        average (bool, optional): Flag to determine if the average distortion over iterations is returned or the worst case. Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        float: The calculated distortion value.
