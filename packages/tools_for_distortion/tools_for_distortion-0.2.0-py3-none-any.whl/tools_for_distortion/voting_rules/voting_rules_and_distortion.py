    Executes the Single Transferable Vote (STV) method for committee elections with fractional surplus redistribution.

    This method processes the voting data to elect a specified number of candidates. It uses an STV mechanism where each voter's ballot has a fractional value, initially set to 1. The method involves electing candidates who reach a vote quota and redistributing the surplus votes of elected candidates to the next preferences on the ballots. If no candidate reaches the quota, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed. This process continues until the required number of winners is elected.
