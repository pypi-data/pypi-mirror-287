### README.md for the Visionlit Package

# Visionlit

Visionlit is a Python package designed to perform computer vision methods. The package provides a command-line interface to verify API keys against a specified service and execute computer vision tasks such as image segmentation.
## Features

- Perform image segmentation (note: actual segmentation logic needs to be implemented by the user).

## Installation

Install Visionlit using pip:

```bash
pip install visionlit
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

You can use Visionlit directly from the command line:

#### List Available Methods

To list all available methods that can be executed:

```bash
visionlit <api_key> <image_path> --list
```

#### Execute a Method

To execute a specific method on an image:

```bash
visionlit <api_key> <image_path> <method_name>
```

Replace `<api_key>` with your actual API key, `<image_path>` with the path to your image file, and `<method_name>` with the method you wish to execute.

### Python Module

You can also use Visionlit as a module in your Python scripts:

```python
from visionlit import Visionlit

# Create a Visionlit object
vision = Visionlit("your_api_key")

# Perform an image segmentation
result = vision.segment_image("path_to_your_image.jpg")
print(result)
```
