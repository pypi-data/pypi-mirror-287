## Introduction

**BlackBox** is a tool that allows you to decode logs from the the ALED Powerboard. The tool is written in Python and uses the following libraries:
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [PyQt6](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro)
- [Bitstring](https://pypi.org/project/bitstring/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

The application works by reading the log file and decoding the data into a human readable format. The user can then view the data in multiple plots and graphs.
