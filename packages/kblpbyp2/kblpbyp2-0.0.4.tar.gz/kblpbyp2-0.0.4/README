While replicating the high-quality PBP data of leagues like the NBA, WNBA, and NCAA for the KBL can be challenging, there are still alternative methods to compile such data. One approach involves utilizing web scraping techniques(i.e., Selenium) to extract information from real-time text updates provided by KBL and platforms like ‘NAVER.’ These updates via text offer descriptions of plays, which allow us to have a rudimentary form of PBP data for further analysis and study after cleansing. By using such form of data, the project aims to demonstrate the types of analysis that can be conducted in the KBL.
