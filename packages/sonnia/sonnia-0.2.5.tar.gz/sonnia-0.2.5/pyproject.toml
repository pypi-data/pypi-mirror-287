description = 'SoNNia is a Python 3 software developed to infer selection pressures on features of amino acid CDR3 sequences. SoNNia takes as input TCR CDR3 amino acid sequences with  V and J genes. Its output is sequence-level selection factors which indicate how more or less represented this sequence would be in the selected pool as compared to the pre-selected pool. These in turn could be used to calculate the probability of observing any sequence after selection and sample from the selected repertoire.'
