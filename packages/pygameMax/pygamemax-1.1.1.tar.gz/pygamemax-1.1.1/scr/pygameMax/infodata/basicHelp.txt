    def screen():

    THis is to be called every time you whant to render the next frame of the window, or used to update the screen.

Object functions:

    an object is handled os a pygame Rect (square / rectangle).

    def create_object(name, x, y, width, height, color):
        This will take all inputs needed for a pygame Rect, anong with a name so you can pick it out through all others.

    def key_move(name, speed):
        this will move an objects with the WASD and/or arrow keys. it will only move the object with the name given. It will be moved by the speed that is also given.

    def move(name, x, y):
        This will move the object[name] to the x, y positioin given.

    def collide(object1, object2): --(nanes of each object)
        Will return True or False if objects are colliding.

    def position(object):
        Returnes the position of the object given as an x, y tuple.

    def remove_object(name):
        will remove the object and all data with it.

Image functions:

    def create_image(name, image_file, x, y):
        Like objects this will create a image that will render on the screen.

    def image_pos(name):
        will return a x, y tuple of the image position

Mouse functions:

    def mouse_X():
        returns mouse x position.
    
    def mouse_Y():
        returns mouse Y position.

    def mouse_pos():
        returns mouse positioin as a tuple.

    def click():
        will return True or False if the mouse was down durring the current frame.

Text:

    def render_text(text, x, y, color):

    def append(file_name, text):
        will apend a new line of data to the file.

Other:

    def clear_screen(key):
        will clear all text, objects, and images, key = "YES".

    def pressed_keys():
        will return a pygame list of the keys pressed, 
        you must use this to acsess if the key was pressed:
        if [varible].pressed_keys()[pygame_K.*key*]:
            pass
