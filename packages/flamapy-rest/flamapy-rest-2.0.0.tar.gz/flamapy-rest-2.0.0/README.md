<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

FLAMAPY Feature model distribution provides an easier way of using FLAMA when analysing feature models. It packs the most used plugins for analyis of feature models adding a layer of convenience to use the framework or integrate it. 

Feature Model Analysis has a crucial role in software product line engineering, enabling us to understand, design, and validate the complex relationships among features in a software product line. These feature models can often be complex and challenging to analyze due to their variability, making it difficult to identify conflicts, dead features, and potential optimizations. This is where this distribution comes in.

Please note: This is a living document and we will continue to update and improve it as we release new versions of the plugins and receive feedback from our users. If there's anything you don't understand or if you have any suggestions for improvement, don't hesitate to contact us. We're here to help!

Three main interfaces are provided:
* A REST API: The REST API allows for easy integration with other tools and applications. It is also a more user friendly interface for those who are not familiar with the command line.

Whant it to runint, simply run
```bash
pip install flamapy-rest
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
```

Alternatively, you can use docker in this way:
```bash
chmod +x start-server.sh
./start-server.sh
```
Or go to [the render deployed version]() it isn't fast, but its free.
