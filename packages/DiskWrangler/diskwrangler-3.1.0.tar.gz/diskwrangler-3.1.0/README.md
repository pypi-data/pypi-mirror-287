### This is Cenbe's Disk Wrangler, an explorer for Commodore 64 disk images written in Python and Qt.

To install, follow these steps:

* You must have Python 3 and the Qt6 libraries (<= 6.4) installed for your operating system.

* It's recommended to install into a virtual environment. You can install from PyPI:

    * pip install DiskWrangler

* Run the program:

    * python -m disk_wrangler

There's a [video](https://www.lyonlabs.org/commodore/DiskWrangler.mp4) of the Wrangler in action that will give you an idea of what it can do.

You can find the source code for both the [Wrangler](https://gitlab.com/Cenbe/diskwrangler) and the [library](https://gitlab.com/Cenbe/d64py) it's based on at Gitlab. There's also a small [companion library](https://gitlab.com/Cenbe/d64gfx) for routines that require Qt6.
