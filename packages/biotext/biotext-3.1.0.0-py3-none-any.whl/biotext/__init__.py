The biotext library offers resources for natural language processing based on
bioinformatics tools. With biotext, it is possible to use native bioinformatics
methods to create text mining strategies. The biotext process starts by
encoding natural language texts in a format based on biological sequences,
which are usable in alignment and vectorization approaches.
