    A class to extract sentences from Nepali text, which includes normalization,
    processing and handling of common edge cases like abbreviations.

    Attributes:
    ----------
    text: str, the text to be processed and from which sentences will be extracteed : TextProcessor
    An instance of TextProcessor to handle text normalization and preprocessing.

    Methods:
    -------
    normalize_text() -> str:
    - Normalize the text using the TextProcessor.

    preprocess_text(normalized_text: str) -> str:
    - Preprocess the normalized text using the TextProcessor.

    - Extract and returns a list of sentences from the text.
