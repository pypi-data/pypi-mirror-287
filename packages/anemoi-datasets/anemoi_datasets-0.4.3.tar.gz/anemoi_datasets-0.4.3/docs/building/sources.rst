The source is a software component that given a list of dates and
variables will return the corresponding fields.

A `source` is responsible for reading data from the source and
converting it to a set of fields. A `source` is also responsible for
handling the metadata of the data, such as the variables names, and
more.

A example of source is ECMWFâ€™s MARS archive, a collection of GRIB or
NetCDF files, etc.

The following `sources` are currently available:
