# juice_segmentation Package

## 1. Getting Started

This Python package provide libs and tools to pre-process (merging/cutting according given rules) wg segment needed for the science planning

The input providing a segmentation proposal with some overlaps between science and operational segments being removed, 
prior to the start of the harmonisation with the WGs.

The tool will allow to produce automatically a set of non-overlapping segments from a set of opportunity segments
by applying a set of simple rules of for merging/cutting segments.

The output will be imported/loaded in Timeline Tool
