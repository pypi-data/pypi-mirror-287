## ‚ö° Overview

**avro.py** provides a fully fledged, batteries-included text parser which can parse, reverse and even convert English Roman script into its phonetic equivalent (unicode) of Bengali. At its core, it implements an extensively modified version of the **Avro Phonetic Dictionary Search Library** by [Mehdi Hasan Khan](https://github.com/mugli).

> The original project ([pyAvroPhonetic](https://github.com/kaustavdm/pyAvroPhonetic)) can only be used on versions up to **Python 2.7** and doesn't contain proper support for Python's third major version AKA Python 3. It is noteworthy that Python 2 has officially been deprecated by the original maintainers and its usage is being discouraged overall. <br>

## ‚ú® Inspirations

This package is inspired from Rifat Nabi's jsAvroPhonetic library and derives from Kaustav Das Modak's pyAvroPhonetic. 

<br>

## üî® Installation

This package requires **Python 3.8 or higher** to be used inside your development environment.

```sh
# Install / upgrade.
$ pip install avro.py
```

#### üì¶ ...or you can try the CLI!

[**avnie**](https://github.com/hitblast/avnie) is a newly developed CLI tool that uses avro.py under the hood. You can install it using:

```sh   
# Install / upgrade avnie.
$ pip install avnie
```

<br>

## üîñ Usage Guide

### 1. `parse()`
This is the most basic use case for avro.py, which includes parsing English Roman script to unicode Bengali:

```python
# Imports.
import avro

# Parsing some text.
output = avro.parse('ami banglay gan gai.')
print(output)
```

### 2. `parse(bijoy=True)`
Alternatively, we can generate the same output, but in compliance with the Bijoy Keyboard format:

```python
# Parsing some text in Bijoy!
output = avro.parse('tumi emon keno?', bijoy=True)
```

### 3. `to_bijoy()`
We can also use avro.py to convert existing unicode Bengali to its Bijoy Keyboard equivalent:

```python
# Converting some text.
bijoy_text = avro.to_bijoy('‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡ßü ‡¶ó‡¶æ‡¶® ‡¶ó‡¶æ‡¶á‡•§')
```

### 4. `reverse()`
Finally, you can reverse unicode Bengali to English as well (newly added).

```python
# Reversing back!
reversed_text = avro.reverse('‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡ßã‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡•§')
```

**Additional Developer Notes**

In short, avro.py doesn't depend on any third-party libraries. However, if you'd like to contribute to the project, you'll need a handful of such useful tools.

**Poetry** has been used to manage the project's dependencies and virtual environment. You can install it by following [the instructions here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). The dependencies have been configured using the `pyproject.toml` file and doesn't require manual installation. Simply set up your developer environment using the following commands: <br>

```sh
# Set up virtual environment and activate it.
$ python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

# Setup project using Poetry.
$ poetry install --sync

# Perform updates on lockfile.
$ poetry update
```

Later, you can run the tests provided with the project using the following command. This option has already been configured in the "Testing" panel if you're using Visual Studio Code as your primary IDE.

```sh
# Run unit tests.
$ poetry run pytest .
```

<br>

### üêõ We're looking for bug hunters, by the way!

If you come across any kind of bug or wanna request a feature, please let us know by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/hitblast/avro.py/issues). We do need more ideas to keep the project alive and running, don't we? :P
