# Time Series Forecasting Toolkit

Timeseriesfcst is a Python package developed as a group project at OpenCampus Kiel. It provides a set of tools for preprocessing, feature engineering, and analysing time series data, as well as implementing LSTM models for time series forecasting.

## Features

- Time series preprocessing
- Feature engineering for time series data
- Time series decomposition and stationarity checks
- LSTM model creation and training for time series forecasting
- Model evaluation utilities

## Installation

You can install the Time Series Toolkit using pip:

```bash
pip install timeseriesfcst
