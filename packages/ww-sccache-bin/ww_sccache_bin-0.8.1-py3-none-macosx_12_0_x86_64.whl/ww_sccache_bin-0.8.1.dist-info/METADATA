Zig PyPI distribution
=====================

[Zig][] is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal, and reusable software. The [ziglang][pypi] Python package redistributes the Zig toolchain so that it can be used as a dependency of Python projects.

[zig]: https://ziglang.org/
[pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/ziglang/

Rationale
---------

Although Zig is useful in itself, the Zig toolchain includes a drop-in C and C++ compiler, [`zig cc`][zigcc], based on [clang][]. Unlike clang itself, `zig cc` is standalone: it does not require additional development files to be installed to target any of the platforms it supports. Through `zig cc`, Python code that generates C or C++ code can build it without any external dependencies.

Usage
-----

To run the Zig toolchain from the command line, use:

```shell
python -m ziglang
```

To run the Zig toolchain from a Python program, use `sys.executable` to locate the Python binary to invoke. For example:

```python
import sys, subprocess

subprocess.call([sys.executable, "-m", "ziglang"])
```
