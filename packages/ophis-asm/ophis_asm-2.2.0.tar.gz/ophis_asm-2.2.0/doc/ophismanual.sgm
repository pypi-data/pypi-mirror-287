    <title>Using the Ophis Assembler</title>
    <partintro>
      <para>
        The chapters in Part 1 are a tutorial guiding you through the
        features and programming model of the Ophis assembler. It uses
        the Commodore 64 as its target platform.
      </para>
      <para>
        This is not a tutorial on 6502 assembly language; those are
        available elsewhere.

    <title>To HLL and Back</title>
    <partintro>
      <para>
        This is a compilation of an essay series I wrote from
        2002-2005 explaining how to apply HLL constructs from
        high-level languages in your assembly language projects.
      </para>
      <para>
        The examples have been updated and modernized for Ophis 2, and
        while the examples all target the Commodore 64, they are more
        generally applicable.
