   suffix to the instruction
 - New example code for Atari 2600, Atari 800, and Apple II
 - Bugfix: charmap now applies to every string in a data directive
 - Bugfix: ASR instructions on the 4502 now properly emit Zero Page
           addressing modes when possible
 - Bugfix: original Atari 2600 example program now runs properly on a
           Harmony cartridge

Ophis 2.1: 24 May 2014
 - Listfile support: passing "-l <filename>" will produce a human-
   readable version of the generated binary, annotated with addresses
   and disassemblies where appropriate
 - Mapfile support: passing "-m <filename>" will produce a map from
   raw addresses in the binary to locations in the code where that
   address was defined
 - Success or failure is now reflected in the process exit code
 - Additional platform headers for the VIC-20
 - Platform headers for interacting with C64 BASIC's floating-point
   libraries
 - Support for the 4502 chip
 - Bugfix: BBXn instructions on the 6502 are now correctly emitted
 - Bugfix: The startup stub code for the C64 now properly handles
           cases where the BASIC program is overwritten during
           program run

Ophis 2.0: 16 Jun 2012

   only parts of a binary file
 - New directives: .advance, .outfile

   .text, and .org/.include pairs.
 - The file "-" may be passed as input or output to represent stdin
   and stdout
 - Out-of-bounds branches will be translated into legal code with a
   warning

   Absolute by appending ".W" to the instruction
 - Sample code, platform headers, and test suite
