Ophis is a cross-assembler for the 65xx series of chips. It supports
the stock 6502 opcodes, the 65c02 extensions, the 4502/4510 used in
the Commodore 65 prototypes, and syntax for the "undocumented opcodes"
in the 6510 chip used on the Commodore 64.

Ophis is written in pure Python and should be highly portable.
