deployed-application-installation-usage-summary
***********************************************


Description
===========

Summarize usage information about an application deployed on Java
servers including installation information during a specified time
period. The main difference between
DeployedApplicationInstallationUsageSummary and
DeployedApplicationUsage is the presence of the applicationSourcePath.
DeployedApplicationUsage provides only an aggregated view to the
deployed applications without installation information. It therefore
doesn’t distinguish between applications with the identical deployment
information deployed to different paths.
DeployedApplicationInstallationUsageSummary contains installation
information, and it’s therefore possible to target actions.
