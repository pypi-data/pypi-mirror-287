# napalm-servertech-pro2

Community NAPALM driver for PRO2 family [ServerTech](https://www.servertech.com/) PDUs running `8.0m` and higher (first version to implement the JSON API Web Service, a.k.a. JAWS).

## Supported features

Given the nature of those "network devices" is a bit particular, some functions cannot be implemented or will not make a lot of sense. First of all, the API only allows us to directly configure elements: it is not possible to confirm or rollback changes.

Please find below the list of supported getters:

* get_config
* get_environment
* get_facts
* get_interfaces (will return the `NET` interface management information and electrical outlets)
* get_interfaces_ip (will only return the `NET` interface management address)
* get_users

## Additional features

The default NAPALM methods don't cover everything we can do on the PDUs (they actually do via CLI, but the driver does not control the PDUs via the CLIs yet). In order to perform actions such as changing the status of an outlet or resetting a PDU, new methods are implemented:

* set_outlet
* restart
