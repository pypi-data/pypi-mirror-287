It's inspired by [Tidal-Media-Downloader](https://github.com/yaronzz/Tidal-Media-Downloader) - currently not mantained project.
This repository will contain features requests from that project and will be the enhanced version.

# Usage

Install package using `pip`

```bash
pip install tiddl

```

You can also use TIDDL as module, it's fully typed so you will get type hints

```python
from tiddl import TidalApi

api = TidalApi(token, user_id, country_code)

my_playlists = api.getPlaylists()

print(f"You have got {my_playlists['totalNumberOfItems']} playlists!")
```
