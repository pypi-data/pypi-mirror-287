This plugin should extend PyVISA's funtionality mainly in order to address local hardware which is attached to a remote node, e.g. USB or GPIB. In the end, you can decouple your VISA instrument hosting where you need bare metal nodes and the test script runner.

## Getting started

### Installation

Using pip:

```shell
pip install pyvisa-proxy
```

### Server

In order to make devices remotely available, just run the PyVISA-remote server on your node. The server will open new VISA resources per request. Just run

```shell
python -m pyivsa_proxy --port 5000
```

in order to host your "local" connections. Use any available port for network sharing.

### Client

Use a client like a normal PyVISA class. The calls will be forwarded by reflection to the server. In order to get started, use the following snippet in your code.

```python
import pyvisa

rm = pyvisa.ResourceManager("YourProxyServerIp:YourProxyServerPort@proxy")
instr = rm.open_resource(resource="GPIB0::1::INSTR")
print(instr.query("*IDN?"))
```
