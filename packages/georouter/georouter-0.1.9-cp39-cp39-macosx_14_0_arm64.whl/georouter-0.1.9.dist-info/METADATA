# GeoRouter

GeoRouter is a python library that provides a highly customizable offline routing engine that allows users to find routes based on scenery and other typical navigation preferences. In addition, GeoRouter provides powerful tools for OSM (OpenStreetMap) and SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) data manipulation and visualization. User's can easily get accurate elevation data by simply providing a latitude and longitude bounding box.

GeoRouter currently supports two routing algorithms: A\* and a custom Bellman-Ford algorithm. The A\* algorithm shortens or lengths corresponding edges based on the user's scenery preferences while the Bellman-Ford algorithm directly incentivizes edges with negative weights which virtually guarantees routes will align with the user's scenery preferences. The Bellman-Ford algorithm is therefore more powerful, but extra compute is needed to prevent negative cycles from forming via backtracking.

## Installation

    pip install georouter

You will also need OSM datasets from either [BBBike](https://extract.bbbike.org/) or [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/). The datasets should be in the form of .osm.pbf files.

SRTM datasets are automatically downloaded by GeoRouter, but a NASA Earthdata account is required as well as an account token.

## Examples

Plot a nice drive through Paris that sticks to the Marne river as much as possible

```python
from georouter import routes
from pyrosm import OSM
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os
import numpy as np

#We want to incentivize a route that goes near water
preference_dict = {
    'sharp_elevation_change': 0,
    'building_density': 0,
    'tall_buildings': 0,
    'wooded_areas': 0,
    'water': 1,
    'high_speed': 0,
    'low_speed': 0
}
#for large datasets you'll want to process the edges separately (time consuming)
#I am using https://extract.bbbike.org/?sw_lng=2.496&sw_lat=48.833&ne_lng=2.581&ne_lat=48.874&format=osm.pbf&city=asdfasdf&lang=en
graph = routes.process_edges(osm_file_name="paris_small.osm.pbf", preference_dict=preference_dict, download_missing_elevation_files=True, nasa_token=os.environ['NASA_TOKEN'], use_negative_weights=True, buffer=.0008)
start_location = (48.83715, 2.5)
end_location = (48.85879, 2.57970)
route = routes.create_route_from_graph(graph, start_location, end_location, negative_edges=True)

#Lets plot the route
nodes, edges = OSM("paris_small.osm.pbf").get_network(nodes=True, network_type="driving")
ax = edges.plot()
vseq = graph.vs
path_coords_lat = np.array([vseq[i].attributes()['lat'] for i in route])
path_coords_lon = np.array([vseq[i].attributes()['lon'] for i in route])
ax.scatter(path_coords_lon, path_coords_lat, color='red', s=15)
plt.show()
```

As you can see, the value 1 may be a bit too strong which causes the route the jump across the river and then back again

Find a non-intersecting drive through downtown Manhattan that goes by as many tall buildings as possible using custom graph

```python
from georouter import area_creator, routes
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pyrosm import OSM
from shapely.geometry import LineString
import numpy as np

#Using https://extract.bbbike.org/?sw_lng=-74.021&sw_lat=40.7&ne_lng=-73.978&ne_lat=40.721&format=osm.pbf&city=Manhattan&lang=en
osm = OSM("nyc.osm.pbf")

#We will consider super tall buildings ≅ 230m or greater
building_areas = area_creator.create_building_boundary(osm = osm, eps=.01, buffer=.0005, tall_threshold=230, min_samples=1)[1] #returns only the tall buildings

#Let's process the edges ourselves to demonstrate how to use routing on a custom network
nodes, edges = osm.get_network(nodes=True, network_type="driving")

#Our goal is to find a route in downtown Manhattan that hits as many tall buildings as possible

#We will create a new column for the user weight with some default value
edges['user_weight'] = edges['length'].copy() * .1

#We will iterate over the edges and set -400 to the user weight if the edge intersects with a tall building area
#Using very large negative values can result in slow compute times since negative cycle prevention becomes tougher
#The built in edge processor uses scaled values proportional to the edge length to avoid this
#Negative values may seem counterintuitive, but they are used to incentivize the shortest path algorithm to go to certain areas
for i, edge in edges.iterrows():
    edge_coords = LineString(edge['geometry'])
    edge_weight = edge['user_weight']
    for polygon in building_areas:
        if edge_coords.intersects(polygon):
            edges.at[i, 'user_weight'] = -400 #doesn't need to be this large, but we want to make sure the route goes through the tall buildings

#convert the nodes and edges to an iGraph using pyrosm
graph = osm.to_graph(nodes, edges)
start_location = (40.70314, -74.01339)
end_location = (40.72021, -73.99358)

#Find the optimal route
route = routes.create_route_from_graph(graph, start_location, end_location, negative_edges=True)

# Plot all the information
ax = edges.plot(color="black", linewidth=0.5)
vseq = graph.vs
path_coords_lat = np.array([vseq[i].attributes()['lat'] for i in route])
path_coords_lon = np.array([vseq[i].attributes()['lon'] for i in route])
ax.scatter(path_coords_lon, path_coords_lat, color='red', s=10)
for area in building_areas:
    x, y = area.exterior.xy
    ax.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

We can see that it doesn't hit all areas with tall buildings, but this is because the shortest path algorithm doesn't allow for path intersections

Utility example - Find driveable places with no nearby buildings

```python
from georouter import area_creator
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pyrosm import OSM

# Find locations with no buildings
osm = OSM("state_college_large.osm.pbf")
# eps is the maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other (in km)
# default is .1, you can and probably should change it depending on how urban the area is
# We will also increase the buffer added to the polygons so that we don't classifiy nodes as isolate when they are not
building_areas = area_creator.create_building_boundary(osm = osm, eps=.03, buffer=.001)[0] #returns only the buildings not the tall buildings

# Plot the areas
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
for area in building_areas:
    x, y = area.exterior.xy
    ax.plot(x, y)

# Okay let's get drivable nodes that are not inside these building areas
nodes, edges = osm.get_network(nodes=True, network_type="driving")
nodes = nodes[~nodes['geometry'].apply(lambda x: any([area.contains(x) for area in building_areas]))]
# Plot the nodes
x, y = nodes['geometry'].x, nodes['geometry'].y
ax.scatter(x, y, c='red')
plt.show()

Most of the points are part of highways, but you can see that it did pick up on an isolated area that appears to be a quarry
