# ENS Card Maker
This is a Python script that takes an ENS name or ETH address, collects information from https://enstate.rs, and generates an image based on information from an ENS profile.

# Web Version
There's a web version of this tool that can be used by going to `https://enscards.littlebitstudios.com/[user]` where `[user]` is the ENS name or ETH address you want to generate a card for.
The code for this version of the script is hosted at https://github.com/littlebitstudios/ENSCardMakerWeb.

# Usage
The command is:
```
enscardmaker <user> [output]
```
Where `<user>` is the ENS name or ETH address you want to generate a card for, and `[output]` is the file path you want to save the card to. If `[output]` is not provided, the card will be saved to `[user].png`.
