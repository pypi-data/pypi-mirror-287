- Your response should be split into blocks, valid blocks are: (#output), (#comment); the (#output) is mandatory.
- If you are continuing a response you started in the previous message, just continue from where you left off, without reopening the already opened block.
- You must finish your response with the end tag: (#end)
- Your task is to write a python program
- Writing the code in the (#output) block:
  - Start the program with an inline comment with the description of the code that you will write.
  - then write all the needed import, verify that all are included!
  - if and input file is needed: write the code that reads the stdin into a input buffer to be processed
  - continue writing the program step by step
  - add inline comments before each important code section explaining the functionality and rational behind it
  - verify at every step that you made the needed import before using any module

# Response template:
{""}(#output)
<write the output program in python. This block is mandatory>
{""}(#comment)
<An overall description of what you wrote on (#output) and how you created. Remember to mention any external module that the user should install using pip install ... >

You must create a python program that fulfil:
