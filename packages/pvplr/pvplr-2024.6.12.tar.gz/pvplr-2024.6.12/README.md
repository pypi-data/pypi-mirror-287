# pvplr: Performance Loss Rate Analysis Pipeline
The pipeline contained in this package provides tools used in the Solar Durability and Lifetime Extension Center (SDLE) for the analysis of Performance Loss Rates (PLR) in real world photovoltaic systems. Functions included allow for data cleaning, feature correction, power predictive modeling, PLR determination, and uncertainty bootstrapping through various methods <doi:10.1109/PVSC40753.2019.8980928>. The vignette "Pipeline Walkthrough" gives an explicit run through of typical package usage.
