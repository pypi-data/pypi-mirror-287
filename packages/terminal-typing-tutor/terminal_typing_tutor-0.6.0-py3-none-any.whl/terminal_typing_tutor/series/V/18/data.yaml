      Your typewriter is equipped with a bell which rings
      to warn you that you are approaching the end of the
      line.

      On some machines, the bell rings five spaces before
      the margin stop is reached; on other machines, it
      rings when there are six or seven spaces left.

      The ring of the bell permits you to keep your eyes
      on the copy.  When you hear the bell, finish the
      word you are typing and throw the carriage for the
      next line.

      Do not look up to watch for the end of the line; you
      may lose your place in the copy.  Always keep your
      eyes on the copy like the expert typist.

      As you have seen in the above sentence practice, the hyphen is used
      for typing compound words.  Here are a few more examples:  up-to-date,
      first-class, by-product.

      The hyphen is used also to divide words between syllables at the end
      of a line.  When the bell rings, finish the word if it is short--less
      than six letters.  If the word is longer, divide it at the end of a syllable.

      The hyphens in the following words show where they could be divided
      at the end of a line:  after-noon, state-ment, hesi-tate, cer-ti-fi-
      cate, exami-na-tion.

      The sum of 10 and 20 and 30 and 40 and 50 and 60 and 70 and 80 and 90
      and 100 and 105 and 106 and 107 and 108 and 109 and 110 equals 1,195.
