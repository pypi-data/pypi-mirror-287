      You type capital letters by holding down a key
      called the shift key while you strike the letter key.

      There are two shift keys.  Hold down the left
      shift key for typing right-hand capitals; hold down
      the right shift key for typing left-hand capitals.
      Always use the fourth finger for the shift key.

      Keep your wrists low but not touching the frame
      of the machine.  Raise the other fingers slightly as
      you depress the shift key with the fourth finger.

      Be sure that you hold the shift key all the way
      down until you have struck the letter key; then re-
      lease the shift key and return finger to home base.

      The backspace key is one of the most useful time-
      saving devices on your typewriter.  You use it to back
      up a space, to darken a light impression, or to pivot.
      To pivot means to type a line so that the last letter
      is at the right margin or other chosen point.

      For example, if you want a date line to end at the
      right margin, place the carriage with the printing point
      indicator at the right margin and backspace once for
      each stroke in the date line.

      The most important use of the backspace key is in
      centering words or lines.
