      (5) Practice Paragraph
    content: |
      Never put off until tomorrow any job you should
      finish today.  Try to be prompt at all times.  No one
      likes to be kept waiting.

      Keep on working just as diligently as you have
      been doing up to this point.  You will soon be a
      master of the keyboard.  You will have a valuable
      skill that will repay you for your efforts.

      Remember this:  every boy and girl is able to
      learn typing.  All they have to do is to put forth
      their very best efforts.  This means thinking while
      training every finger to strike the right key.
