      The next key we are going to practice is the right shift key.
    content: |
      Whenever you want to capitalize a key on the left side, you must use the
      right shift-key.  To do so, follow these steps:

        a.)  Without moving your first finger from the J-key, swing the
             fourth finger of your right hand over to the SHIFT-key and
             hold it down.

        b.)  Strike the key that you want to type with your left hand.

        c.)  Immediately bring your fourth finger back to the ;-key.
