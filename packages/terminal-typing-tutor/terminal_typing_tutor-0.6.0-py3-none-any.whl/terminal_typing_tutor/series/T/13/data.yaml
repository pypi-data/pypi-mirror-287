      There is no Lesson 13!  Don't you know that 13 is an unlucky number?

      If you have completed Lessons T1 through T12, then you are now ready
      to call yourself a touch typist.  You have learned to touch type all
      of the keys which are standardized!  You can now begin the SPEED
      series of lessons if you would like.  (If you come across a punctua-
      tion symbol which you have not learned, simply look for it.  Use the
      appropriate finger for the shifted numeric keys.  Use your ;-finger
      for all the keys on the right-hand side.)

      We will practice touch typing on the keyboard layout for the remaining
      lessons.
