      NUMERIC KEYS
    content: | 
      The terminal has two sets of numeric keys.  One set--directly above the
      alphabetic keys--conforms to the standard for typewriter keyboards.  The other
      set--to your right--resembles a calculator keypad.  In this typing series we
      will be concerned only with the standard numeric keys on the main keyboard.
      (If you would like to learn to touch type on a numeric keypad, use the N-series
      lessons instead.)

      NOTE - not all terminals have the numeric keys in a separate keypad

      The numeric keys, like all the keys you will be learning from now on, vary
      somewhat from machine to machine.  The 2 through 0 keys are always in exactly
      the same place on all typewriter keyboards.  (On keypunch machines and some
      terminals, however, they are located over the U, I, O, J, K, L, M, comma and
      period keys.  We will not be concerned with these layouts in this series.)
      Even if a typewriter or terminal has the standard 2 through 0 keys, it may not
      have a 1 key.  If it does, the 1 will always be next to the 2.  If it does not,
      you will have to use the L-key.

      As we stated earlier, many typewriters do not have a 1 key.  Let's practice using the L-key as a 1, so you can use any kind of typewriter.

      In both octal and decimal, ll times ll is l2l.  And, 3 minus 4 is -l.
      But in octal, l2 is not divisible by 3.
