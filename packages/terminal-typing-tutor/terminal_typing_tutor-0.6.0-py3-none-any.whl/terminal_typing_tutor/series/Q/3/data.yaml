      You learned first the letters that are most frequently used in the English
      language.  They are repeated over and over again.

      One space always follows a comma.  Don't forget there are two spaces between
      sentences, no matter what punctuation mark closes the sentence.

      The colon (:) introduces a list and is followed by two spaces.  Finger usage:

       'j' for 'y', 'f' for 'r', 'k' for ',', 'd' for 'c', ';' for '?', 'p' and ':'
