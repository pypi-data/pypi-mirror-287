      Dear Rollin,

           I did notice a number of the pretty places I passed in
      the air nearly two months ago, and I can at length locate
      the best.  If prices remain rather low, I will not return
      for any person or be prompt at orders.  I can play a record
      or two, and not regret there is no report to be looked at.
      I want to be myself and regard nature, not people.

           To obtain this latter result is the proper reason for
      making this quiet trip.  So far from the public, matter in
      the papers will be old and market policy of little moment.
      It will please me to have you with us longer than the others.
      I was really living for the period when I would be placed with
      you both.  Your mother has a lovely manner.  I am glad to
      oblige so recent a member of our office, too.

           This letter is being mailed Monday, and in two days we
      shall go.

      Yours sincerely,

      Dear Sylvia,

           I wonder if my sister talked to you on Sunday of the
      thirty things we wanted to do this summer?  We were trying
      all the spring season at school to secure a supply of sim-
      ple but strong materials for a camp in the valley.

           It struck me as we were taking a walk down the street
      that we would surely be unable to do as we stated unless you
      took a sudden notion to help.  It seemed to me on second
      thought we should give thanks to you for giving tongue to our
      wishes last winter, for you turned the folks in our favor.

           My sister was saying that girls from twenty states had
      signed our pledge, so we are united.  Though this is off the
      subject, I saw a pretty yellow and silver dress within a win-
      dow on Main Street toward our corner.  Would you think it
      suitable for the writer?

      Sincerely yours,

      (5) Pointed Paragraph (a q)
    content: | 
      I acquired a bequest from a quizzical Quaker.  How
      to apply it was a quandary.  As a quasi artist, I began in
      Albuquerque to make a quantity of plaques of chance Indian
      acquaintances.  My masquerade as an artist of quality in
      that quaint land of quite Spanish art and adobe was adequate
      and equally unique.  Squeezed in quiet, antiquated adobe
      quarters, I began quickly and without qualms to qualify as
      an artist.  After quarrels and questions over my queer tech-
      niques, I acquired my quota of opaque plaques.
