      (8) Pointed Paragraph (a o)
    content: | 
      To attain a personal association with so popular an
      author is an approved social ambition.  To loan him money or
      catalog his books we consider a favor.  Today his tailor, later
      with a coat, loads on him a thousand pardons.  A normal Mon-
      day program allows a lazy forenoon to ocean and boat; after-
      noon to various auto roads in orange season; night to play
      contract or follow the local opera.  As soon as he can account
      for another book, our author is anxious to go abroad.

      "Has #4-4 gone?" she asked, rushing in out of the cold.
      "No--why $4?" the station agent* answered (he had won- 
      dered why she was so worried).  But he wasn't to find out--
      for a white hand pushed back $15 and picked up an old copy
      of Good Housekeeping from a seat.  She began to read.  When
      he noted she had chosen "Winter Comfort" he was 100% amused.
