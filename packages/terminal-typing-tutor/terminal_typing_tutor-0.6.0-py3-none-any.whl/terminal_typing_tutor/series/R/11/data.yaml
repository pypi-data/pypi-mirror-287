      In this lesson we start on the top row, which has the numerals and
      4-key and the 5-key; the J-finger presses the 7-key and the 8-key.
      Either the F-finger or the J-finger may press the 6-key.

      I have finished Grade 9B.  In my first weeks of typing in
      Grade 10A, I learned to use all the keys in Lessons 3 and 4.
      In Lessons 1 and 2, and in part of No.5, I tried my hands on
      the home row.  Both Lessons 6 and 7 were in the bank above.

      Typing is clerical work.  Twenty years ago less than 5 per
      cent of all those at work had clerical jobs; today, about 8
      per cent have such jobs.  Does it interest you that of all
      paid typists only 3 per cent are more than 44 years of age?
      Most of the 810,000 typists in the last census are young.

      To throw a carriage do you take 6 or 7 times--or to shift for
      a capital, 2 or 3 times--as long as to hit one letter?  And
      do you know the common keys?  One common pair of letters is used
      for every 3 or 4 other pairs, even though there are more than
      600 other pairs.  The digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
      You will spell these out more often than you will type them.
