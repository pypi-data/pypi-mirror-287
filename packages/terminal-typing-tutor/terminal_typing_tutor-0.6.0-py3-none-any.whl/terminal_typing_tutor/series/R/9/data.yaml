      (4)

      Dad was vexed.  He said that he might as well burn his bonds

    content: |
      Dad talks about a jinx.  He says that maybe their bank will
      close so he cannot pay up taxes and bills before Christmas.
      Dad says they all may have to exist on home-grown wax beans.

    content: |
      Dad adds that boys ought to be busy and maybe play ball or
      box at the club.  Bill excels, but says he cannot box on
      wax beans alone.  Beef must be back on the board.  Bill has
      boxed as an extra at a bazaar.  He is big, and able to box.

    content: |
      Bill begs Dad not to be blue, and his text is this:  We
      are all in the same boat.  No one can buy.  No one can build.
      Labor is hard hit, too.  I, for one, would like to toss the
      cards on the table and start a new deal.  When exact codes
      are fixed, as best for all, every person must do his bit.

      (8) Pointed Paragraph (f y)
    content: | 
      Satisfy yourself that it will be funny, but perfectly
      satisfactory, for forty or fifty of the faculty to fly from
      Buffalo to New York on the first Friday in February.  If
      they prefer, we will offer them waffles, jelly, and coffee
      before they fly or get dizzy.  Sixty flyers can qualify
      confidently to face any difficulty.  A friendly inquiry
      from any family will be very cheerfully and fully answered.

      (8a) Pointed Paragraph (i d)
    content: | 
      Children find being quizzed in division, addition, and
      reading difficult.  They studied daily during their third
      period and tried to be confident.  I think they did include
      Florida and Rhode Island in their wide reading; and have
      just decided to dispose of Detroit, Grand Rapids, Richmond,
      Providence, and Philadelphia next week.

      (9) Test Paragraph
    content: | 
      By using the new banks of keys on the new keyboard, you
      are able to learn or excel with less labor.  These new banks
      have been based on an exact table of words used.  You begin
      at once on the best bank.  On the old keyboard you have to
      type most of the text on the next bank above and on the bank
      below.  Because of this fact your fingers bound back and
      forth between the upper and lower banks of keys.  But those
      extra jumps necessary on the old keyboard do not exist on the
      new keyboard.  Nor is your left hand taxed with extra labor.
      The keys are fixed to keep both hands busy and in balance.

      Those boxes of books for New Mexico may be ready next week.
