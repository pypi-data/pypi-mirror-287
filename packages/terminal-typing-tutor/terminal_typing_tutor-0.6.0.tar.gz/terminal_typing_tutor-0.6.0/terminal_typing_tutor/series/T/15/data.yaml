      In this lesson 
    content: |
      We will be practicing the special symbols which you will need
      for BASIC or other programming languages.  I won't give you too much practice
      with these symbols right now.  (You should be able to get plenty of exercise by
      simply typing in programs.)

      150 PRINT
      175 PRINT "AX^2 + BX + C = 0"
      200 INPUT A,B,C
      210 IF A = 0 THEN 400
      225 D = B^2 - 4*A*C
      250 IF D < 0 THEN 500
      275 PRINT "ONE ROOT IS: ";-B+SQR(D)/2/A
      300 PRINT "THE OTHER IS: ";-B-SQR(D)/2/A
      325 STOP
      400 PRINT "NOT A QUADRATIC.  TRY AGAIN."
      425 GOTO 100
      500 PRINT "COMPLEX ROOTS.  TRY AGAIN."
      525 GOTO 125
