      Character shows itself in a man's conduct.  Deeds speak
      louder than words.  Words sometimes confuse an issue where
      deeds clarify it.  The test of a man's sincerity is not what
      he says but what he does.  Consider this well and you will
      never be confused in estimating a man's worth.
