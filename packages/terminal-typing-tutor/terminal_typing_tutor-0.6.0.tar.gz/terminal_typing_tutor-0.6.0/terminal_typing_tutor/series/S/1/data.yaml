      SPEED PRACTICE SERIES
    content: |
      The S series of lessons is designed to help you improve your typing speed
      and accuracy.  It is assumed that you have already learned how to touch
      type either from a previous course in touch typing or from the T series of
      these lessons.

      You can use this series even if you do not know how to touch type.  But, it is
      recommended that you at least learn to touch type most of the letters of the
      alphabet before starting this series.  When you encounter a letter or symbol
      which you have not learned, you will have to look.  This is a very bad habit to
      get into and is hard to break.  (You needn't worry if you only need to glance
      down for unusual keys, like the dollar sign.)

      Dear Sirs:

      I have just purchased a Heathkit H89 computer system and would
      like to order two boxes of diskettes for it.  This system uses
      5 1/4 inch, hard-sectored, ten-sector, single-sided, single-
      density diskettes.

      Enclosed is my check for $45.00.  Please rush this order, as I
      can not use my system before they arrive.

      Sincerely,

      Mr. Smith

      Dear Sirs:

      Thank you for sending the diskettes so promptly.  How-
      ever, the diskettes which you sent are for soft-sectored
      drives.  As I stated in my original letter my system
      accepts only ten-sector, hard-sectored diskettes.

      I will return these two boxes as soon as I receive the
      correct ones.

      Sincerely,

      Mr. Smith
