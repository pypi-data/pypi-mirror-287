    intro: | 
      Romeo and Juliet, Act II, Scene II (Capulet's Garden).
    content: |
      But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
      It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!--
      Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
      Who is already sick and pale with grief,
      That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
      Be not her maid, since she is envious;
      Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
      And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.--
      It is my lady; O, it is my love!
      O, that she knew she were!--
      She speaks, yet she says nothing:  what of that?
      Her eye discourses, I will answer it.--
      I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:


      Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
      Having some business, do entreat her eyes
      To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
      What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
      The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
      As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
      Would through the airy region stream so bright
      That birds would sing, and think it were not night.--
      See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
      O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
      That I might touch that cheek!

    intro: | 
      Julius Caesar, Act III, Scene II (The Forum).
    content: |
      Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
      I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
      The evil that men do lives after them;
      The good is oft interred with their bones;
      So let it be with Caesar:  The noble Brutus
      Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
      If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
      And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
      Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,--
      For Brutus is an honourable man;
      So are they all, all honourable men,--
      Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
      He was my friend, faithful and just to me;
      But Brutus says he was ambitious;
      And Brutus is an honourable man.


      He hath brought many captives home to Rome.
      Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
      Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
      When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
      Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
      Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
      And Brutus is an honourable man.
      You all did see that on the Lupercal
      I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
      Which he did thrice refuse:  was this ambition?
      Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
      And, sure, he is an honourable man.


      I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
      But here I am to speak what I do know.
      You all did love him once,--not without cause:
      What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?
      O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
      And men have lost their reason!--Bear with me;
      My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
      And I must pause till it come back to me.

    intro: | 
      The Merchant of Venice, Act IV, Scene I (A Court of Justice).
    content: |
      The quality of mercy is not strain'd;
      It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
      Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd;
      It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
      'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
      The throned monarch better than his crown;
      His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
      The attribute to awe and majesty,
      Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;


      But mercy is above this scepter'd sway,--
      It is enthroned in the heart of kings,
      It is an attribute to God himself;
      And earthly power doth then show likest God's
      When mercy seasons justice.  Therefore, Jew,
      Though justice be thy plea consider this--
      That in the course of justice none of us
      Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
      And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
      The deeds of mercy.  I have spoke thus much
      To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
      Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
      Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.

      The Tempest, Act III, Scene I (Before Prospero's cell)
    content: |
      There be some sports are painful, and their labour
      Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
      Are nobly undergone, and most poor matters
      Point to rich ends. This my mean task
      Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
      The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead,
      And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
      Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed.
      And he's composed of harshness. I must remove
      Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up,
      Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
      Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
      Had never like executor. I forget:
      But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
      Most busy lest, when I do it.

      The Tempest, Act IV, Scene I (Before Prospero's cell)
    content: |
      You do look, my son, in a moved sort,
      As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.
      Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
      As I foretold you, were all spirits, and
      Are melted into air, into thin air:
      And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
      The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
      The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
      Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,
      And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
      Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
      As dreams are made on; and our little life
      Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;
      Bear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled:
      Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:
      If you be pleased, retire into my cell,
      And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
      To still my beating mind.

      The Tempest, Act V, Scene I (Before Prospero's cell)
    content: |
      But this rough magic
      I here abjure; and, when I have required
      Some heavenly music,--which even now I do,--
      To work mine end upon their senses, that
      This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
      Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
      And deeper than did ever plummet sound
      I'll drown my book.
