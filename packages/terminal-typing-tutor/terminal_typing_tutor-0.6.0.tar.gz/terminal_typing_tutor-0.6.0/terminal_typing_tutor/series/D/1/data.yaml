    content: |
      The quote of the day changes every day. Check back tomorrow for a different quote! It's possible that non-ascii characters were fetched from wikiquote, in which case they
      were either substituted with the closest ascii equivalent or replaced with '***'. Also, some quotes may be excessively long and may not display properly. Feel free to skip them,
      for now.
