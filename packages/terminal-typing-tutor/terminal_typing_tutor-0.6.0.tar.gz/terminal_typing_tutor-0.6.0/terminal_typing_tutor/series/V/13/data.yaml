      The slant is controlled by the semicolon finger.
      It is used in such abbreviations as n/c, which means
      NO CHARGE; and c/o, which means CARE OF.

      If you work with zeal and zest, you will soon be a
      competent typist.  The ability to type well is a
      very valuable asset.

      You can develop your typing skill quickly by the proper
      habits of work.  You should realize that poor work is a
      mere waste of time.  Try to be exact.

      Every business firm is dependent on the services of
      competent typists.  You are now equipping yourself with
      a skill for which there is a constant demand.
