      Dear Dan,

           Yes, I came out of the corn, back to the city, both to
      draw and to do copy on the new cars.  To date I am able to
      put cash in the bank and bear a bill or two.  The new deed
      has done it.

           The city has been busy but cold for two days.  Dear baby
      has been to see her best aunt.  A band came by the door.
      Baby let the bird cage drop down with a blow.  The bird died.
      Boys put its dead body deep in a dark card case.  Baby also
      has a ball and blue book to drop.  I put the boat away.  Its
      deck did burn, but I care not as it does not cost a cent.

           Come, call on me at the club.

      Yours sincerely,

      Dear Bea,

           I am glad you feel so for the farm in the East.  Even
      as a girl of four or five I was ever so glad to find the
      farm.  In my eyes it was all as good as gold.  Even my feet
      felt good.  A girl can gain and grow fast on farm food and
      the fine free air.  Why else did face and form grow full
      and fair so fast?

           On each foot of my farm I felt free from fear.  It
      gave me my fill of fun.  I felt no fear of any fire in the
      fall.  Now the fire is a fact and my farm is gone.  Give me
      my full life, etc.  The game goes on.

      Yours sincerely,

      Dear Hal,

           Just a line to say I am lost if I cannot fly.  I
      have to keep on here.  I knew it was but a hope last May.
      It was just my last idea in June.  Yet I held my head high
      and did not lose hope.

           Why not fly up in the air a half hour or less and
      look at my lake and our home on the hill?  I left it late
      last July with one item on my list.  Bill gave me half an
      hour of help.  Like the lady of the lake I met the king.
      Bill was a kind king, too.

           To lead off into the air and see all our lake so
      long and lots of land so low, was to live a high hour.  I
      kept my hand at my ear so as to help hear.  In the air my
      hair was a loss.  It did not kill me.  I have to fly to know
      life can be less hard.  I like to hold on and help Bill.  I
      love to fly.

      Yours sincerely,
