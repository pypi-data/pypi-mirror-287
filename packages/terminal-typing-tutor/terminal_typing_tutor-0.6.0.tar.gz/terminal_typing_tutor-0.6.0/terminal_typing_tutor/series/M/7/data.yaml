      Dear Mr. and Mrs. Blank,

           Your son has not called on me.  If he is to become almost an
      annual charge upon the county, the church will answer with action.
      Yet, I am afraid his arrest can not assure his coming around and
      asking us for advice.  Of course he has to appear before August.
      He bought on credit, got behind in cash, and the amount became too
      big.  I shall pay it.

           You are an old couple, and I advise you to accept this.  Any-
      way, he is not a common boy and must have a chance.  He always does
      appear to anyone as fit.  I run across copies of his art.  I can
      advise your son, attend to his credit, and try to help him arrive
      at a change for the better.

      Sincerely yours,

      Dear Dick

           I have a dollar.  I expect you to follow me and take dinner.
      Friday I didn't have cash, but a friend of the family had enough
      for both of us.

           Father is having all the lot, except the garden, filled in
      during the week.  Giving in to his desire, I intend to work the
      ground.  Doctor says that my health is hardly an excuse, so I had
      better decide to make an effort.  Indeed, I am driven either to
      finish the work in the near future or pay to have it done.

           I am hoping you will happen upon some kindly fellow to whom
      a flower garden itself is fun, and inform me.  I shall direct him,
      as the entire effect will lie in the way we handle the ground
      plan.  Don't forget.

      Yours sincerely,

      (5) Pointed Paragraph (q z)
    content: | 
      I quit the quiz when I saw the quantity of queer hazy
      questions.  To seize lesser prizes required answers to a
      dozen queries.  Only a quarter of the quotas qualified with
      zest.  Many had zero when the quiz asked:  In what zones are
      Brazil, Switzerland, Arizona, or Texas?  Zebras in our zoos
      grow to what sizes?  Analyze and quote one great citizen's
      query as to zeppelins.  Criticize the quality of jazz music.
