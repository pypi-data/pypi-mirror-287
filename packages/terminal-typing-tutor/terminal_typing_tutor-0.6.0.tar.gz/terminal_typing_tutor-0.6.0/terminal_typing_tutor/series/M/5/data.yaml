      Dear Fred,

           I have dared to ask you for an extra favor on the first.
      If you are not dated, I am to draft you to drive me by horse
      or car up the grade to the field house at eight.  I guess you
      have not heard fully about the great dance to be given by the
      girls on the floor of the field house.

           My hands have put fresh green goods on the walls.  Every
      girl has a green dress, on its front a funny glass heart that
      she gives as a favor.  The old folks can drive up early, eat
      and drink and enjoy it all.  We will delay the dance till the
      girls enter in a dozen files.  It would crush me to death if
      an error were found in the plans.  Happy hours on earth are
      never heavy.  Can you doubt that you are going?

      Sincerely yours,

      Dear Madam,

           I have your two later notes of March 1.  Maybe it is a
      large order for you to leave for the north in the month of
      March.

           Our place is miles away, but the real issue is that mu-
      sic means much to us.  A night of music, even one piece of
      music, has often meant more to me than my local paper and all
      the power I have known.  If I can plant a love of music in all
      parts of this place so that all who hear you sing can learn to
      love it, it will mean more to me than money.

           I never laugh at money, but isn't it plain in these
      lines that price ought to be the least of all the items?  The
      point is that our plans for your party are more important.  If
      you read our other offer in the light of our love for music,
      we might not seem so far away.

      Yours sincerely,

      (5) Pointed Paragraph (u y)
    content: | 
      If truly quoted, you and Guy, mere youths, fly a con-
      tinuous journey of thousands of miles yearly in your study
      of numerous flying routes.  You say you were south in July
      in the dry country conspicuous for yucca, but now you are
      busy buying a quota of various useful items to supply your
      outfit for the famous Yukon.  Yet I am suspicious when you
      say this unusual survey is monotonous rather than glorious.
      You should hurry surely to Vancouver for some delicious
      yuletide fare.  It seems only yesterday that I was conscious
      of being young and vigorous enough to fly my buoyant plane.
      If you lucky boys are victorious over any unusually furious,
      dangerous, or anxious double duty on this survey, write a
      quotable account yourself for the Journal.
