      Dear Alice,

           I shall start my river story since you have shown you like
      my style.

           The scene is a state in the South.  A sweet girl speaks of
      the sound and sight of the river.  Seven men without shame raise
      the stock sales and the boy tries to spend too much at the store.
      In order to make a quiet and quick slide down the river, the men
      seize the boat while the others, who are quite ready to serve the
      girl, sleep.

           It seems the girl has sense, for on a sheet of paper she
      writes that her stock of gold is within reach from a round stone
      under the small shade tree.  She does not quote the boy, but does
      refer to the sorry end of his short study, and in her reply to his
      folks she will state how the gold may still be spent in the right
      way, which will stamp the story as real.

      Yours sincerely,

      Dear Mrs. White,

           I wish to thank you for the words you wrote three weeks ago,
      and I trust you will write again on the wrong and waste of war.

           As I watch the wheels of events today, I think you value a
      thing it has taken me a third of my years to see.  In its total
      trade the world is one whole, and each part in touch with the
      other at most times.

           The usual farm woman won't see a trade table or understand
      its terms, for she is tired with her efforts to train and teach
      her young.  She has tried to throw her value into her home, which
      to her is worth so much.  War can not be put under until these
      women see there is but one world, which truly is their world.

           Where will you be while the thick wheat is harvested?  If
      not across the water, would you visit us, using your voice to
      teach us these things?

      Yours sincerely,

      (5) Pointed Paragraph (n m)
    content: | 
      Important dinner company in our small apartment was
      not common, and November ninth mamma was solemn in manner.
      The moment nine American gentlemen were announced, fun and
      argument began.  I remember one ancient gentleman, manager
      of much more income than mine, who was not solemn as imag-
      ined, but funny and human, even if normal demand, planned
      movements of modern machines to Canada, long term payments,
      and columns of numbers meant much more to him than to me.
