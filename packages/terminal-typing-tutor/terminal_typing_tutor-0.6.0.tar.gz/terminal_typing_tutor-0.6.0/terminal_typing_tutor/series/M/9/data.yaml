      Dear Annabel,

           My brother and his college friends in the factory decided to arrange an
      evening exactly as in the old days.  After calling us, they arrived and we
      carried out the idea.  We used an old college catalog and each girl had an
      old college dress.

           Further to advance the evening, my brother advised us of an old address
      near the freight yard where certain college boys brought this or that article
      and were allowed a few dollars.  As we went in, an old man came a step farther,
      fell forward and against me.  Brother charged him.  Will you believe this care-
      ful account I enclose?  Between brother and me lay this old man who did seem
      dead.  I can't express my feeling.  His head was covered with marks of blows.

           Already we were anxious to go.  Yet his safe was open, as if to furnish us
      the old books with the many expense charges against the college boys.  When I
      looked to see who of our company were in them, I read one balance after another
      paid from the old country to My Dearest Son.  You are correct if you guess we
      now ran, because we did.  What follows?  Today's paper doesn't have a line.

      Yours sincerely,

      Dear Mrs. White,

           I have been holding on, but this January I am getting out.
      My wife herself may have told you of our opening.  However, I go
      at ten o'clock this morning, and your husband is still out.  He is
      to do my general work himself, and may not imagine there is any
      measure of justice in that.  We married men are obliged to do as
      ordered.

           I am leaving a hundred matters.  He has my opinion on each.
      Tell him the minutes of the last meeting of the members are on my
      table.  Tell him I haven't an invoice, but have instead an October
      bill, for our new machine parts.  He may mention this item to the
      manager, as he has neither its history nor my letters of inquiry.

           I find nothing else to include.  We shall miss you greatly,
      and we shall be looking for you at our new home.

      Yours sincerely,

      Dear Patrick,

           I realize that this letter I am sending may subject you to some trouble.
      I am writing tonight without waiting to go through various reports on our
      present program.  If I had thought that you would be willing to give me an
      extra day, perhaps I would have come myself.

           As soon as this letter has reached you, and you have finished reading the
      several items about which I have written, I hope you can give extra working
      time to my request for special records. These items will suggest a new plan as
      I picture it.  I shall add them to this note.

           It is my purpose to prepare a fast station-to-station service that should
      be in running order soon.  I suppose it could be started next month.  Let me
      ask, also, whether we could receipt each payment, as we receive it, on a
      regular form similar to those in the package shipped you Tuesday.  I am pleased
      with your showing.  You have been like a soldier on duty in any and all
      weather.  Success is your teacher.

      With my best regards,
