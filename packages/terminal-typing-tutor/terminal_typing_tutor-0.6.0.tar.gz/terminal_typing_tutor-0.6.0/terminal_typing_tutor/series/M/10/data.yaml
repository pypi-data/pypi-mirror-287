      Dear Thomas,

           First, I consider of definite interest anything from
      the business of as good a customer as you.  As director of
      our division, I am to continue handling building material.
      My judgment on all the evidence, which I send herewith
      enclosed in a second envelope, is one of complete approval.
      Let me have a contract covering the earliest delivery date.
      Are you advising me what increase in your discount is to be
      expected?

           Second, this forenoon I saw your son and he told me of
      his marriage in February.  Although you had not entirely
      finished the addition to your lake house by last December,
      couldn't you exchange it, as it is, for my mountain home?
      Your son said that his young wife wants to live on this
      mountain to which all your children seem so attached.

      Sincerely yours,

      Dear Nathan,

           My last shipment has probably been received, for the purchase was made
      Thursday.  Tomorrow is Saturday, a pleasant day, for I go on my vacation.

           Do you remember an original idea you proposed last November relative
      to planning for some shipping from my property?  My neighbor recently
      called it a plan in a thousand, and we must get together so that I can
      thank you properly.  This is a national as well as personal question,
      and I am trusting that you will be thinking that it is possible for you to
      help put it into practice.

           If you can possibly separate yourself from teachers and your
      teaching position sometime soon, plan to get a standard car and
      whatever else is required for the trip.  The car would also be a
      pleasure after you return to New York.  May I persuade you in re-
      plying to state that you are planning to come promptly?  We will
      make you one of the officers of the shipping business.

      Yours sincerely,

      Dear Son,

           I am beginning this afternoon to give my immediate attention
      to a Christmas that should be beautiful.  I have addressed, to be
      forwarded and delivered in good condition, some new equipment
      according to your wish.  I note, too, that your committee met.
      What these gentlemen said is important and may be a sort of in-
      surance that your plan does not fail.  I certainly would not want
      to duplicate for you the kind of education given me.

           Be different by following more than one new idea, including
      some of your own.  If you can carefully take fair advantage of
      every available condition, everybody should accept you cordially,
      as answering to the character of a gentleman.  Mother is enclosing
      a few lines.

      Yours sincerely,
