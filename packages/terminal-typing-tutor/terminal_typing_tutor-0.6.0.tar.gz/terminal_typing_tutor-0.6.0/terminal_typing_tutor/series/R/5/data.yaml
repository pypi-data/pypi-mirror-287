      If you read copy set your eyes on that copy and stay on it.
      If you hear copy then use your eyes to hit sure and fast.

      Do not hurry.  Set a nice rate.  Yet hit each letter fast.
      To strike letters start easily and fast and use a light touch.
      You can not type lightly and faster if you start to pound.

      It is a slip if you do not use a letter in its right order,
      since in line after line each has its place on the paper.
      You soon learn the usual order for all letters that you type
      and learn to print the letters in any necessary order.

      It is easy at first to make errors by losing this usual order.
      If you read, hold the eyes on copy to help get this order.
      If you do hit this or that letter out of order, it is not
      that you fail to spell.  You can spell and yet not type;
      this fine class drill is to help the type fly in fair order.

      Dear Tom,

           Mr. May has one new car.  It has a low red top.  The top
      is so low you can not see the sun if you sit in the car.  Mr.
      May has not let his own son use it.  I saw his son try to put
      the top up.  I ran and met him.  Why not be men and run the car
      out?  We did.  We set out to run it at six.  We two ran it off
      to an old lot by the sea.

           Did his pa see us?  Yes, sir, who but Pa was at No. Ten
      as we ran by in the car--and Ma, too.  Oh, it was war--his pa
      had a lot to say.  Let me lay out the law to you.  You may not
      use the car as you did not pay for it.  You are not yet a man.
      Son did not lie nor did he win his way.

           How are you all?  Now if you get a new car, let me run it.

      Yours sincerely,

      (9) Pointed Paragraph (t c)
    content: | 
      Is it quite certain that the citizens could continue the
      old conditions if they voted a straight ticket?  If we accept
      as accurate the picture of recent conditions, we can not crave
      to continue them.  We lack the tact to get the citizens to
      vote a split ticket.  Tax collectors try to collect taxes on
      vacant lots.  A discount for cash increases collections.

      In order to type fast you hit lightly after each short delay.
