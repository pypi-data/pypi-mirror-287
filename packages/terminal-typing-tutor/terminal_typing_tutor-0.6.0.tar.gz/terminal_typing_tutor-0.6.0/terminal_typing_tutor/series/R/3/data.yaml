      As a rule it is the real line drill that helps one to learn.

      It helps to read a line as soon as one can.  It helps to see
      its sense.  This, indeed, helps to hold each line until done.

      As soon as one hits a hard place then one plans to drill on
      this part.  Later one can drill this hard part again.  In
      order to end an error one can drill all the old line again.

      Learn the sound as one uses loose hands to type out a line.
      As one types his usual rate he ought to learn its sound until
      at this rate all the line has the usual, clean, clear sound.
      As soon as the usual rate is lost one can hear it as a slip.

      Total lines that one turns out tell all that one is young.
      In order that this class also can print a large line total,
      it still helps to spell; it also helps to print all the line
      as one line, and it helps less and less to drill single
      letters.  Each one in the class can tell his total lines.

      Dear Ted,

           A day ago Ann got a bad cut on her arm and a few by her
      eye and ear.  It is an act of God she did not die.  Her car
      did the job.  It is the end of her car.  She has no use for a
      car.  The fee is to be big.  She is in bed, but she can not
      eat.  She can not eat a bit of egg.  It is no fun at all.

           It is hot.  It is too hot for her fur hat, but I can buy
      a box for it.  I am due any day.  I can cut a day if I fly.
      It is not far if I go by air.  If I go by car, I add a day.

           How is Dan?  Did he get his job?  Dan had to beg for it
      if he did.  He is big and fat but not bad.  The boy can do
      it if he can act to fit his age.  Ask him not to act as a kid.

      Yours sincerely,

      (9) Test Paragraph
    content: | 
      To tell this class all there is to learn is not a real
      help later.  Let the class plan the loose ease that can hold
      each hand in place, or plan to end this or that poor slip,
      or plan to do its total lines in less hours.  As a rule, to
      plan and to do are also to learn.  The class plans to drop
      the old action to clear the road.  Those old slips are lost.
      The class has large plans; gains in hours and less slips.

      (10) Rhythmic Review

      To learn to read or spell a rule helps less than to drill.
