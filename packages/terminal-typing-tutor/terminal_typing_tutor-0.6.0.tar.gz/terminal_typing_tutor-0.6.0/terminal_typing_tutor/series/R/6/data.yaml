      I must see the warm colors, and feel the wind on that land.
      I want to see a few cows among great rocks and sage brush.

      I like to hear a horse stamp.  I like the sweat on a horse.
      I want to keep a camp, close to water, miles from any crowd.
      At night, I want to enjoy a moon that shines on all the land.

      Yet I am in this city room to type news items for the paper.
      I know the ins and outs of my city--its mayor, judge, jail.
      I know how some men keep in power, and some get only kicks.
      I am sick of dark ways to make money, of bribery and fraud.

      I want to hear the talk of folks who know hot sun and stock.
      I like to join in jokes with men whose names I do not ask.
      So had I just an old motor car and some gas to make it jump,
      I would come at forty miles an hour, past fields of wheat,
      till the grade grows high and rough, in keen air out West.

      Please report the people who study typing.  You may
      truly say that money paid for this study is happily spent.
      Today typing plays a very practical part in acquiring a
      paying position.  We can use plenty of these days for exact
      work in typing:  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
      and Saturday.  Have you this sized type to print your copy?

      (9) Test Paragraph
    content: | 
      Were you the judge in a case like this, could you do the
      just thing?  An old woman who keeps rooms hides her money
      under a clock.  A man using one of the rooms motors rapidly
      away.  The old woman says her money is gone.  We join in a
      hunt for the man who is found in the West.  We take from him
      the same sum of money.  We try to make him sweat and talk.
      I use my power to set his term at ten years.  After he is put
      in jail, the old woman finds her money still under the clock.
