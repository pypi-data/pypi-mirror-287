      Today I quit being vexed with the old job.  I must seize
      one extra bit of zest and join the exit from the big city.

      To begin with, the same old auto will bear us to the beach
      where a good-sized boat floats easily in the blue water.
      Our boat is build for room.  Her cabin has a busy table.

      I know Nan will come if Bill does, and Ted likes to be with
      Ann.  I would never quite have the nerve to keep my good
      board back when our club navy moves out into the quiet water.
      We leave at an early hour when the sun is still under cover.

      All day will be warm and novel.  The far banks will slide by
      while we gaze.  She is an out-and-out able boat, heavy but
      never gives trouble.  She is never taxed in quick water.  I
      feel the water jump and break.  Queer how I feel the bond
      that exists between me and my boat.  She is a prize I value.

      Some women swim in the spring.  Some women swim in
      the warm water of summer.  Women in Brazil may swim even in
      November.  Some women from Japan will swim tomorrow.  We want
      to show the women from New Mexico and Wyoming how to swim in
      winter.  We will work with them for a few weeks.  When they
      go home we wonder if they will write from time to time.

      (8A) Pointed Paragraph (i o)
    content: | 
      I'm going to obtain oil options tonight and to file my
      copies without noise, or outside notice.  I am anxious to
      avoid an action.  If I voice an official opinion, I will omit
      serious points.  Knowing conditions, I am hoping that I'll
      be enjoying a glorious addition to my income.  I am going to
      join society and be social with juniors and seniors alike.

      (9) Test Paragraph
    content: | 
      Bound for some place where the sun sets in the west,
      soon it is the night that I favor.  Next to the night and
      boat and water, maybe I judge our sail by its excellent bill
      of fare.  Here I am very exact, as I never set a poor table.
      I stock an up-to-date table, set out under the first dozen
      stars.  I enjoy having every boy able to quaff his quota of
      soup and boast or sing with zeal and make any queer joke.
      With a moon, I can name no event to equal a boat and water.

      It is good drill to keep going in even time for ten minutes.
