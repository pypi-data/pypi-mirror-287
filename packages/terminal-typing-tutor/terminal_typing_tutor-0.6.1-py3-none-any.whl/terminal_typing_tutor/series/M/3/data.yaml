      Dear "Pie,"

           I open most of my mail and meet the news.  I note that
      you say Mrs. Page is a mere name but you met the Miss Page.

           You must need the car.  Once the pass is open I can move
      the car over to you.  Do you mind if I make it part of a nice
      plan to meet Miss Page, too?  Mrs. Page was only a mile past
      us.  Her son was my age and I made the mile at noon to play a
      bit.  She paid us for milk.  She did not mean much to me, but
      her son did.

           Next we had more fun up the pass near the poor old No.
      Nine mine.  I can mark many a mile we once ran.  I must mail
      this note or I may miss the post.

      Yours sincerely,

      Dear Ross,

           It is a real rain.  The road is so soft my car can but
      roll, stop, and roll on.  Are you on the ship?  If I get as
      far as the ship, can we sail in such a rain?  If we try to
      sail, the ship is sure to rock or ride on one side.  If I get
      sick, it is up to you to stay by and show us how to save the
      ship.  Ann has some sort of song to sing in the rain.  She
      said she sent it to you.

           Did you read of our sale?  We set out a big sign.  Now
      any sort of suit and any size seem to sell.  We are not rich
      but we can soon step out or be sold out, if any such rate is
      to rule.

           Ann has not seen the ship as yet.  Rain or no rain, Ann
      says to send her out.  All the rest of us say the same.  Can
      you ring me in my room at the shop?

      Yours sincerely,

      (5) Pointed Paragraph (i u)
    content: |
      The public is quite unfair about airing quibbles over 
      house furniture and fruit juices for the university crew.
      The alumni inquiry into the failure of equipment figures in
      the issue.  The alumni attitude is useful but continues to
      put a premium on a victorious crew.  Only genius can guide
      this outfit uphill and build a suitable crew that won't quit.

      (6) Pointed Paragraph (d s -)
    content: | 
      Students should be assisted in studying seated at their
      desks; cross-questioned as to their needs and desires; ad-
      vised to use up-to-date leads based on studies of standards.
      By-products of student days, well-bred friends, kindness,
      self-help, with good grades and degrees, are listed as far-
      sighted aids.  In Dad's old-fashioned address to his co-
      workers, he said sadly that ideas are missed less than first-
      class friends and good-natured wishers.
