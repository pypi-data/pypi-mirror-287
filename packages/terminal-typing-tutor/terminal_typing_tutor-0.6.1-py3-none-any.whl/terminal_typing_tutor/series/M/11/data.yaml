      Dear Gertrude,

           This letter has no reference to shipments which you have
      so kindly purchased from me in the past.  Rather, as you are
      returning to this territory by September, our president has re-
      quested me as secretary to ask that you make a statement before
      our club the first Wednesday.

           Let me say something of the questions we have been receiving
      for the year.  Recently I read that the old principle today still
      applies.  It is wonderful what our new knowledge has surprised us
      into regarding as necessary for ourselves--sometimes things not
      even mentioned yesterday.

           Will you therefore represent this new deal and present the
      situation to us in principle, sincerely, as you see it?  Other-
      wise, if you cannot make this provision now, I shall be glad to
      call upon you later.

      Yours sincerely,

      Dear Alex,

           We are especially interested in the settlement run by a
      new department at the University.  We appreciate the importance
      of its additional study to understand impossible conditions in
      the poor parts of our city, and its use for adjustment of some
      particular boy or girl.  Have you read our memorandum in this
      connection?

           Our city is absolutely too big.  With the automobile we can
      distribute every person to his home along a line, our wide road,
      run far out from the city.  The difference between country and
      city grows less and less, in accordance with such use of the auto-
      mobile.

           Concerning our collection of any remittance from you, this
      would serve to form a Conference which would develop everything
      that can make city governments bring full and rich experience
      to all.

      Sincerely yours,

      Dear Sir,

           I wish to acknowledge the recent interesting correspondence
      from your office on the very considerable requirements of the new
      law that have to do with any unfortunate advertising that might
      appear in my papers.

           Our association also has appreciated both your instructions
      and the opportunity for prompt examination and understanding of
      the new arrangement, particularly its application to all informa-
      tion given the public about merchandise for sale.  This has been
      a real convenience in our consideration of the entire proposition.

           I want to assure you that our co-operation under the new law
      will be satisfactory in every way.

      Yours respectfully,

      (6) Pointed Paragraph (l r z)
    content: | 
      The JOURNAL learned that the relatives on their arrival in
      April had already referred the trouble to lawyers.  Their early re-
      turn surprises me.  As to the children themselves, the older girls
      are personally agreeable, slender, and certainly full of zest.  They
      travel yearly and already are familiar with the world.  Their father
      was a quizzical old man who fairly idolized them.  His will leaves
      them very nearly a half-million dollars.  Only the earlier, first
      will is very irregular.  I've already quizzed them about the real
      hazards of quarrels over legal prizes of similar size.  From their
      replies I've realized slowly that the girls are all right.  It
      really amazes me that even persons like ourselves promptly seize
      upon some hostile relative's version of an earlier will, which
      should be recognized easily as false.
