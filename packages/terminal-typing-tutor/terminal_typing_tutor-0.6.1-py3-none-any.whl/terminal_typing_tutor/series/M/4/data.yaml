      Dear Tris,

           It is so very warm at this time of year, I told my wife
      that you and I wish to go west for a week or two.  Did I
      tell you what a wind we had?  I went to town to vote for the
      one man whom I want.  I took a well-used tire.  When it went
      down on a bad turn, in the woods, I had to walk.  Then the
      wind more than set in, and I had to wait by a wall.  It got
      our old tree.

           I saw two men and set them to work on the car, till
      they told me it was no use.  If I were to turn it in, is it
      true that you can take your car?  I want a wide view and I
      want to talk with you.  Thus I wait upon your word.  Wire
      yes if you will take this trip.

      Yours sincerely,

      Dear "Cab,"

           Could you apply to the court to allow my claim as agent
      for Mr. Blank?  I could bring in his books and see about his
      bills.  If asked, he can cover the costs by checks on a bank
      that did not break.

           Will you allow your child to come alone to see me?  He
      can have every apple he can carry.  By the way, being clean
      and above board, you must be above bad cases, but you began
      to bring in off-color cases after April.

           I agree you do not cross the law, but why let men win
      in a black cause on any basis?  Why not build up your cases
      from among men of our own class?  Close the awful cases you
      now carry along to court, and begin again.

      Sincerely yours,

      (5) Pointed Paragraph (r t)
    content: | 
      In our motor party on the return trip an attractive
      quartet first tried to tell thirty or forty short travel
      stories.  By turns they transferred to the theater, to art
      matters, to court trial stories.  In the latter a certain
      doctor is hurt by a first truck, another truck is struck,
      and three contractors are thrown to the street.  The girl's
      strong brother has been hurt.  Further, there are arrests
      and the sort of extra details that enter into true stories.
