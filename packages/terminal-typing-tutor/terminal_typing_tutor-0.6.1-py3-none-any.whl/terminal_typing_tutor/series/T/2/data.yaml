      When you reach for any of these keys, be sure to return your finger to its
      home position.  For example, to hit the H-key, move the first finger of your
      right hand (the J-finger) slightly to the left.  Tap the H-key and immediately
      bring your finger back over the J.

      If you lose track of where your fingers are guess.  Don't look!
