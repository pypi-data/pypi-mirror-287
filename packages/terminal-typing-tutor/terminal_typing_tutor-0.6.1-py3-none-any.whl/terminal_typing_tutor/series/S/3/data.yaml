      A Christmas Carol, Stave One, Marley's Ghost
    content: |
      Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all par-
      ticular about the knocker on the door, except that it
      was very large.  It is also a fact, that Scrooge had
      seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
      in that place; also that Scrooge has as little of what
      is called fancy about him as any man in the city of
      London, even including--which is a bold word--the
      corporation, aldermen, and livery.  Let it also be
      borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one
      thought on Marley, since his last mention of his
      seven year's dead partner that afternoon.  And then
      let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened
      that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,
      saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any inter-
      mediate process of change--not a knocker, but Mar-
      ley's face.

      Gulliver's Travels, Chapter One, A Voyage to Lilliput
    content: |
      When I awaked it was just daylight.  I attempted to rise, but I
      found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to
      the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied to the
      ground in the same manner.  I likewise felt several slender
      ligatures across my body, from my armpits to my thighs.  I
      could only look upward; the sun began to grow hot, and the
      light offended my eyes.  I heard a confused noise about me;
      but in the posture I lay could see nothing except the sky.  In a
      little time I felt something alive moving on my left leg,
      which, advancing gently forward over my breast, came almost up
      to my chin; when bending my eyes downward as much as I could, I
      perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high, with a
      bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back.  In the
      mean time I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I
      conjectured) following the first.

      Treasure Island, Chapter IV, "The Sea Chest", by Stevenson.
    content: |
      I lost no time, of course, in telling my mother all that
      I knew, and perhaps should have told her long before,
      and we saw ourselves at once in a difficult and dangerous
      position.  Some of the man's money--if he had any--was
      certainly due to us; but it was not likely that our
      captain's shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by
      me, Black Dog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to
      give up their booty in payment of the dead man's debts.
      The captain's order to mount at once and ride for Dr.
      Livesey would have left my mother alone and unprotected,
      which was not to be thought of.  Indeed, it seemed
      impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the
      house:  the fall of coals in the kitchen grate, the very
      ticking of the clock, filled us with alarms.

      Treasure Island, Chapter IV, "The Sea Chest", by Stevenson.
    content: |
      The neighborhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by
      approaching footsteps; and what between the dead
      body of the captain on the parlor floor, and the thought
      of that detestable blind beggar hovering near at hand,
      and ready to return, there were moments when, as the
      saying goes, I jumped in my skin for terror.  Something
      must speedily be resolved upon; and it occurred to us at
      last to go forth together and seek help in the neighbor-
      ing hamlet.  No sooner said than done.  Bareheaded as we
      were, we ran out at once in the gathering evening and
      the frosty fog.
