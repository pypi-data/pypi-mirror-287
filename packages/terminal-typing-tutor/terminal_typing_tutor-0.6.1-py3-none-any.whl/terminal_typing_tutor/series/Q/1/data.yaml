      Welcome to lesson Q1.
    content: |
      In the Q series of lessons, we will be learning to touch-type on the standard   
      keyboard.  I will introduce you to each letter on the keyboard, one at a time.  
      By the time you have completed this series, you will be able to type the entire 
      alphabet, the numbers, and most of the punctuation keys by touch.

      If you have never taken any lessons in typing before, please be patient.  Typing
      is not difficult but it does take a lot of practice.  Avoid the tendency to     
      look down at your fingers while typing.  This is a very bad habit and is hard   
      to break later.  If you hit the wrong key, I will let you know.  (But, I won't  
      tell anyone else, so don't worry about it.)

      If you have always used the hunt-and-peck method, you will have an even harder  
      time keeping yourself from looking.  Don't be surprised if you find touch       
      typing slower than your old ways.  It may be slower when you first start.       
      But, touch typing is far faster once you get the hang of it.

      If you can already touch type, you should be able to go through these lessons   
      fairly quickly.  Or, you may want to go directly to the S series.

      The HOME Keys.
    content: |
      In order to hit the correct keys by touch alone, you must always know where your
      fingers are.  The way to do this is to have a special place for each finger.
      This key is called the HOME position.

      Place the first finger of your right hand on the J-key.  Now, place your second
      finger on the K-key, your third finger on the L-key, and your fourth-finger on
      the ;-key (the one with the : and ; on it).

      Similarly place the four fingers of your left hand on the F, D, S, and A-keys.
      Place your right thumb over the SPACE bar.  (Henceforth, always hit the SPACE
      bar with this thumb.)  Now, lift all your fingers slightly so that they are
      poised just over the keys.  Each finger should be just barely touching its home
      key.  This is an electronic keyboard and does not take much pressure to ac-
      cidentally press the key down.

      Above the D-key is the E-key.  Above the K-key is the I-key.  Learn these
      positions well.  Whenever you are about to type a line, look at your fingers and
      make sure they are in the HOME position.  Then don't look at them again.

      DRILL PATTERNS
    content: |
      For the rest of this lesson, I will display a line of text in the middle of the
      screen and instructions at the top of the screen.

      All you have to do is type in the characters that you see in the middle of
      the screen.  If you hit the correct key, I will not do anything.  If you make
      a mistake, I will display a large X under the letter that you got wrong and
      beep the terminal. In either event, just keep going by typing the next letter.

      When you have finished typing the line, hit the RETURN key.  To do this, extend
      the little finger of your right hand over to the RETURN key.  Hit the key and
      zip the finger back to its home position.  Be careful not to let your other
      fingers move far from their home positions in the process.  Also, be careful
      not to type an extra space at the end of the line.

      If you made no mistakes on the line, I will display the next drill pattern.  If
      you did make a mistake, I will beep at you and make you do the line again.  If
      on the second try you made more than two mistakes, I will beep again and make
      you try again, etc.  Don't forget to use your right thumb for the SPACE bar.
