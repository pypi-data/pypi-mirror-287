    content: |
      During all those years of experimentation and research, I never
      once made a discovery. All my work was deductive, and the results
      I achieved were those of invention, pure and simple. I would construct
      a theory and work on its lines until I found it was untenable. Then
      it would be discarded at once and another theory evolved. This was
      the only possible way for me to work out the problem. ... I speak
      without exaggeration when I say that I have constructed 3,000 different
      theories in connection with the electric light, each one of them reasonable
      and apparently likely to be true. Yet only in two cases did my experiments
      prove the truth of my theory. My chief difficulty was in constructing
      the carbon filament. . . . Every quarter of the globe was ransacked
      by my agents, and all sorts of the queerest materials used, until
      finally the shred of bamboo, now utilized by us, was settled upon.

      I never did anything worth doing by accident, nor did any of
      my inventions come indirectly through accident, except the phonograph.
      No, when I have, fully decided that a result is worth getting, I go
      about it, and make trial after trial, until it comes.

      X-rays ... I am afraid of them. I stopped experimenting with
      them two years ago, when I came near to losing my eyesight and Dally,
      my assistant practically lost the use of both of his arms.

      'Nature is what we know. We do not know the gods of religions.
      And nature is not kind, or merciful, or loving. If God made me - the
      fabled God of the three qualities of which I spoke: mercy, kindness,
      love - He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His mercy,
      kindness, and love for that fish come in? No; nature made us - nature
      did it all - not the gods of the religions'

      Some day some fellow will invent a way of concentrating and
      storing up sunshine to use instead of this old, absurd Prometheus
      scheme of fire. I'll do the trick myself if someone doesn't get at
      it. . . . Sunshine is spread out thin and so is electricity. Perhaps
      they are the same, but we will take that up later. . . . This scheme
      of combustion to get power makes me sick to think of - it is so wasteful.
      It is just the old, foolish Prometheus idea, and the father of Prometheus
      was a baboon. When we learn how to store electricity, we will cease
      being apes ourselves; until then we are tailless orang-outangs. You
      see, we should utilize natural forces and thus get all of our power.
      Sunshine is a form of energy, and the winds and the tides are manifestations
      of energy. Do we use them? Oh, no; we burn up wood and coal, as renters
      burn up the front fence for fuel. We live like squatters, not as if
      we owned the property. There must surely come a time when heat and
      power will be stored in unlimited quantities in every community, all
      gathered by natural forces. Electricity ought to be as cheap as oxygen,
      for it can not be destroyed.

      If our nation can issue a dollar bond, it can issue a dollar
      bill. The element that makes the bond good, makes the bill good, also.
      The difference between the bond and the bill is the bond lets money
      brokers collect twice the amount of the bond and an additional 20%,
      whereas the currency pays nobody but those who contribute directly
      in some useful way. ... It is absurd to say our country can issue
      $30 million in bonds and not $30 million in currency. Both are promises
      to pay, but one promise fattens the usurers and the other helps the
      people.

      My mind is incapable of conceiving such a thing as a soul.
      I may be in error, and man may have a soul; but I simply do not believe
      it. What a soul may be is beyond my understanding.

      We really haven't got any great amount of data on the subject,
      and without data how can we reach any definite conclusions? All we
      have - everything - favors the idea of what religionists call the
      Hereafter. Science, if it ever learns the facts, probably will find
      another more definitely descriptive term.

    intro: Quotes from Thomas A. Edison
    content: |
      There is a great directing head of people and things - a Supreme
      Being who looks after the destinies of the world. I am convinced that
      the body is made up of entities that are intelligent and are directed
      by this Higher Power. When one cuts his finger, I believe it is the
      intelligence of these entities which heals the wound. When one is
      sick, it is the intelligence of these entities which brings convalescence.
      You know that there are living cells in the body so tiny that the
      microscope cannot find them at all. The entities that give life and
      soul to the human body are finer still and lie infinitely beyond the
      reach of our finest scientific instruments. When these entities leave
      the body, the body is like a ship without a rudder - deserted, motionless
      and dead.

      Tom Paine has almost no influence on present-day thinking in
      the United States because he is unknown to the average citizen. Perhaps
      I might say right here that this is a national loss and a deplorable
      lack of understanding concerning the man who first proposed and first
      wrote those impressive words, 'the United States of America.' But
      it is hardly strange. Paine's teachings have been debarred from schools
      everywhere and his views of life misrepresented until his memory is
      hidden in shadows, or he is looked upon as of unsound mind. We never
      had a sounder intelligence in this Republic. He was the equal of Washington
      in making American liberty possible. Where Washington performed Paine
      devised and wrote. The deeds of one in the Weld were matched by the
      deeds of the other with his pen.
