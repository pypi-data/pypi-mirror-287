      Typing is a very valuable skill to acquire.  It is
      valuable for personal use and as a means of getting
      an office job.  This skill is yours to use; it can
      never be taken from you.

      So why not put forth your best efforts to become a
      good typist?  You can become a good typist if you
      put your mind to it.  You should also, if possible,
      learn shorthand.  Typing and shorthand are two very
      valuable skills to have.

      These two skills will help you get a good start
      in the business world.
