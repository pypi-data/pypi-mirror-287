      To type fast, it is just as important to release the
      key quickly as it is to strike it quickly.  Expert
      typists do this; you too, can do it, with practice.

      One good way to develop this technique is to practice
      familiar words and phrases.  Type them over and over
      again until you get the knack of hitting the keys quickly
      and releasing the fingers instantly.
