      Nan gets us going.  The dance is on.  Ted pounds the piano
      as Ann stops to go to the phone.  She has to get the gang.
      This chance scene passes too soon.  I hope it happens again.

      At eight papa said that he ought to put out his good pipe
      and then get a good nap.  Soon papa is snug in a deep nap.
      At eight ten I guess the dance gets going.  At ten it stops.
      As papa put it, such singing upsets him enough for one night.

      Get the gang.  Catch this sign.  Get going.  Go up this high
      post and put a sign on top.  Put these copies on each post.
      I guess no one intends to stop us.  The cast is set.  Each
      scene is set.  Each act can open in good shape.  I hope that
      enough cash is paid in so the cast need not stand the costs.

      (8) Pointer Paragraph (o e)
    content: | 
      Only too well do we know about your house.  Mother told
      me you hope to be settled there quite soon.  Of course she
      would enjoy seeing the whole house next week.  Before then
      please write her a letter to let her know how to get there
      from here.  We know you have moved to a very cozy new home.

      (9) Test Paragraph
    content: | 
      The High dance opens at eight and the gang is going.
      So Ted shuts the piano and stops at the phone to catch Ann.
      I ought to post Ted that he pounds the piano as I once did.
      I guess he is upset.  He has to catch Dad to get the cash.
      He has to see Ann to each dance.  This is not a noisy night.
      His auto is a cheap one and no good on a night such as this.
