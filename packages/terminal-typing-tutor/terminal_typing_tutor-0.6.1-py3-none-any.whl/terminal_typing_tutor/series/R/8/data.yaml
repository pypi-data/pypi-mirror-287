      I'd never call Dan lazy; still, I can't say he wins prizes.

      Doesn't Dan know how to make an exclamation point?  He'll
      have to hold down the spacer and hit the apostrophe and period.

      Owing to Dan's zeal, he'll get the point; he'll realize it's
      faster.  He'll use it when amazed, as:  Whiz!  He'll use it
      when he feels real zest, as:  Zip!  Let's go!  It's a fire!

    content: |
      A dozen small-sized craft frozen in the ice are afire under
      a cold azure sky.  It's near zero in the fire zone; and over
      the ships now razed to the water's edge, a light haze hangs.
      I'm dazed as I gaze at my own ship; I'd never recognize that
      crazy maze of still fizzing ruins as a deck.  What a fizzle!

      Isn't there a lot of zip and zest to your work on a paper of
      this size?  Don't you like to seize some amazing news item
      that's good for the first page?  If Tom's hazy fire story is
      a fizzle, why won't you squeeze it to a dozen lines?  Isn't
      that easy for you?  I've wanted to see my name in print; I
      guess I'll sail in a zeppelin to see if you'll print that.

      (8) Pointed Paragraph (r n)
    content: | 
      A note from Ann says her friend prefers to change her
      return to Arizona from next February to November.  The reason
      is an error of the owner of the ranch who will not refund
      her rent.  The janitor is running some errand, for he has
      worked in the rain near the northern entrance during dinner.
      I hear that now neither her friends from North Carolina nor
      Virginia can remain an afternoon and refrain from a quarrel.

      (9) Test Paragraph
    content: | 
      I'll admit I seize a chance to go with these dozen
      people.  We left under an azure sky, yet today it's rainy
      and hazy.  That Dr. Tedd is odd; he won't play; he's doing
      a report on how to zone cities of any size; so he won't let
      us dance to radio jazz.  Tonight we're to try a play that
      hasn't any zest or zip.  Its prize is Tom's money, and he'll
      not stay; he feels it's a fizzle.  My zeal for gazing on the
      crowd is at zero.  They don't and can't pass any play quiz.

      (10) Rhythmic Review
    content: |
      It's crazy for me to type news items on paper of this size!
