      some cities, but only to 40, 43, 47, 50, 51, 52, 60 in other
      cities.  Rain fell from .00 or .04 to .40 or to .68 inches.

      The next step in better typing is to learn to graph a curve.
      If your test score each week rises from 22 to 28, 32, 37,
      40, 44, 48, 51, 53, and 55 words a minute, put these on a
      chart.  See this curve grow higher each week.  Or use bars.

      The usual test scores point to waste in many a class.  After
      all the work of a first term, girls may reach only 25 words
      a minute, boys only 22 words.  At the end of 34 weeks these
      usual scores might be 29 or 31 or 34.  Indeed, 25 to 33 per
      cent of the students may type less than 20 words per minute.

    content: | 
      Eleven invitations for Thanksgiving vacation arrived in
      advance of November.  In vain have a dozen relatives invited
      me to visit Vermont, Virginia, and Nevada.  I love being
      invited and I believe in never avoiding an invitation to any
      Thanksgiving banquet.  I even plan to have the sixth to the
      seventeenth of November for varied ventures and to visit
      that novel Denver University on my vacation.

      (9) Test Paragraph
    content: | 
      How much do you weigh?  A young boy who is 5 feet tall
      may weigh 112 pounds; with an extra inch, 115 pounds.  Add 3
      pounds for any inch added.  Thus if 5 feet and 4 inches, he
      may weigh 124.  If taller, add 4 pounds for each added inch.
      If 5 feet and 7 inches, he may weigh 136; if 5 feet and 9
      inches, 144; if 5 feet and 10 inches, he may weigh 148.  Now
      add 5 pounds for each added inch.  Thus to stand 6 feet tall
      may mean 158 pounds.  It is better to be a little over-weight.
