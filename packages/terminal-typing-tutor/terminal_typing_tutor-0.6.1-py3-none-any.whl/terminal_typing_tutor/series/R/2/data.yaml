      In order to raise a poor grade one tries to use good sense.
      An error is a sure sign not to do the thing that one did.

      seen or heard again, note its sort and end it right there.

      the letters that she has to print.  Is this order upset?
      Is she tired?  Then she needs a short rest.  Is it the rate?
      She need not raise her rate too high.  Has she a good touch?
