      The HOME Keys.
    content: | 
      In order to hit the correct keys by touch alone, you must always know where your
      fingers are.  The way to do this is to have a special place for each finger.
      This key is called the HOME position.

      Place the first finger of your right hand on the J-key.  Now, place your second
      finger on the K-key, your third finger on the L-key, and your fourth-finger on
      the ;-key (the one with the : and ; on it).

      Similarly place the four fingers of your left hand on the F, D, S, and A-keys.
      Place your right thumb over the SPACE bar.  (Henceforth, always hit the SPACE
      bar with this thumb.)  Now, lift all your fingers slightly so that they are
      poised just over the keys.  Each finger should be just barely touching its home
      key.  This is an electronic keyboard and does not take much pressure to ac-
      cidentally press the key down.

      Learn these positions well.  Whenever you are about to type a line, look at your
      fingers and make sure they are in the HOME position.  Then don't look at them
      again.

      DRILL PATTERNS
    content: |
      For the rest of this lesson, I will display a line of text in the middle of the
      screen and instructions at the top of the screen.

      All you have to do is type in the characters that you see in the middle of
      the screen.  If you hit the correct key, I will not do anything.  If you make
      a mistake, I will display a large X under the letter that you got wrong and
      beep the terminal. In either event, just keep going by typing the next letter.

      When you have finished typing the line, hit the RETURN key.  To do this, extend
      the little finger of your right hand over to the RETURN key.  Hit the key and
      zip the finger back to its home position.  Be careful not to let your other
      fingers move far from their home positions in the process.  Also, be careful
      not to type an extra space at the end of the line.

      If you made no mistakes on the line, I will display the next drill pattern.  If
      you did make a mistake, I will beep at you and make you do the line again.  If
      on the second try you made more than two mistakes, I will beep again and make
      you try again, etc.  Don't forget to use your right thumb for the SPACE bar.
