      We will be practicing the shifted numeric keys on the
      terminal keyboard.  I will only be giving you practice in the keystroke
      motions.  Very few sentence drills or speed exercises are included, since these
      keys are used so infrequently.

      If you are typing something which includes one of these special characters and
      you cannot remember where a key is, look.  But, always make sure to hit the key
      with the correct finger.  (If you do use the key often, you will eventually
      learn where it is without looking.)  Since these keys are used infrequently and
      are in different places on most other keyboards or are totally missing, speed
      is not important.

      THE END

      You have now completed the T-series of these lessons.  If you have not already
      done so, you should now start the N-series or S-series.

      There are a few keys which we have not studied.  If you decide to touch-type
      these keys, use the closest finger.  Thus, the ESC, TAB, CAPS LOCK, and SCROLL
      keys use the A-finger.  And, the keys to the far right (BACKSPACE, DELETE, LINE
      FEED, RETURN, }, {, etc.) use the ;-finger.  The upper keys (f1, f2, etc.) are
      not usually touch typed as the reach is too far.  If you can, fine.

      The CONTROL and REPEAT keys are difficult to touch type, but are treated like
      the SHIFT keys whenever possible.  For example, to REPEAT an exclamation point,
      hold the REPEAT key down with your ;-finger and then hit the ! with your A-
      finger.  Certain command sequences, such as Control/S, are hard to do this way.
      Many people simply hold the CONTROL-key down with their A-finger and then hit
      the other key with whatever finger is convenient (usually the F-finger in this
      case).
