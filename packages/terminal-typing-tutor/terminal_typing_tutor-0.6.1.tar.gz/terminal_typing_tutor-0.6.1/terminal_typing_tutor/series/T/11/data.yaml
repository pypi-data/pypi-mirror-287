      Dear Sirs:  The 10:00 meeting on March 10 has been postponed until 10:30.
      The 10:30 meeting was moved to 11:00 in Room 302.
      But, Room 302 can only hold 10 people.  We will need Conference Room 10.

      Let's try some paragraphs.

      Zip codes are arranged so that the first 3 digits
      designate the regional office and the last 2
      digits designate the local branch.  The numbering
      is roughly east to west.  That is, numbers
      starting with 0 are in New England, numbers
      starting with 1 are the New York area, etc.
      There are notable exceptions to this rule,
      however.  The Virgin Islands are south of
      Florida, but their Zip Codes start with 00.

      The new nine digit zip codes have upset quite a
      few people.  It was bad enough being referred to
      as 73218.  But now, we will have to remember
      numbers like 73218-4208.  The worst hit will be
      the companies whose mailing list programs were
      poorly designed.  Those unstructured programs
      will be very difficult to change.
