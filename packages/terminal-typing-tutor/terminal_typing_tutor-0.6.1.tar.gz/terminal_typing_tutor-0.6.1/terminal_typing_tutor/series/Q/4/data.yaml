      Self control is important in learning to type.  Concentrate on using the
      correct finger for each key.  In this lesson you learn the seven remaining
      letters of the alphabet.

      The semicolon (;), like the comma, is followed by one space in a sentence.

      Fingers:  'j' for 'm', 's' for 'w' and 'x', 'f' for 'v' and 'b',
      ';' for ' and '-', 'a' for 'z' and 'q'
