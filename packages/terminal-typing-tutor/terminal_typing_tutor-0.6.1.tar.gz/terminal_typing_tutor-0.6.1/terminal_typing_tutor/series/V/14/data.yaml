      Touch typing is easy to learn.  You do not need a mind
      that is above the average.  You do not even need a
      special talent for typing.

      All you need is the will to learn.  The lessons in this
      book do the rest of the job for you; they make touch
      typing easy for you to learn.

      Try to set aside each day a definite amount of time for
      each lesson.
