      Covers were laid in the unique ivory room.  Even the king

      The queen was ready to quaff when her glass fell.  At once
      all was quiet.  Every one, save one alone, quit the dance.
      In all their lives, to quote, was never a thing more grave.

      Who was the lady with the vivid hair in the dress of heavy
      gold?  Who was this queer one who dared so treat the queen?
      Each guest did quail.  Could such quiet nerve ever avail?
      With a move quite free and easy the lady let fall her glass.

      The queen put this query in a quick voice to quell them all:
      Why does the whole world love a lover?  Why do we value you?
      All did laugh.  The queen asked that, as a favor, you give us
      those who have nerve, for they can love and serve.  Quite as
      one who gave an equal favor, the queen sang over the radio.

      The earliest possible sales lessen the total losses.
      Please enclose the latest details in those lists yourself.
      On almost all calls I could save six dollars, especially in
      July.  Tell the girls all the usual questions asked will be
      useful shortly.  Use a small-sized envelope to post letters.
      Last but not least, all else should still go on as usual.

      (9) Test Paragraph
    content: | 
      In our queen city I used to value two covers set every
      day.  At these I used to serve a young man and a girl.  I did
      love to see her quiet dress and quick smile favor her so.
      I have never quite seen her equal, or a girl so very alive.
      After I had given over this work, I went there to see them.
      One night I saw a query form on her lips until she gave it
      up and took leave.  The way she quit the boy was very queer
      even if the papers did quote his prison term as five years.
