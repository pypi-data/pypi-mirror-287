      Dear Ted,

           After I read your dandy note I felt sorry for the lady.
      Here is plenty of cash if you young people agree to spend it
      sanely.  Is it for a natty sail or only for golf?  Did you and
      Dan play or fight?  Dan said he felt as if a full load of
      coal hit his head.  Is that fact or fancy?

      Yours sincerely,

      (7) Pointed Paragraph (a s)
    content: | 
      Sadness possesses her as she stands against the panes
      that the sash separates.  She is sad because the same dress
      is not washed and in shape; and so she says it is useless to
      save it.  She is sad also because she has to stay in Alabama
      next season.  She says to plan to sail across the seas to
      Alaska or Asia or Spain is useless.  So in June she amuses
      herself by drawing five or six quaint, small-sized maps.

      (8) Test Paragraph
    content: | 
      They say this fruit is the finest.  It is full and good.
      Dr. Ted feels the first fruit is too green for young or old.
      After one eats any of it he is sorry.  In fact, if I try it,
      that night in fancy I sail the South Seas for eight hours.
      The air is fine and clear; on the ship are only fruit and I.
      To a lady in those seas I gladly offer all fruit and candy.
      There is no reply.  Only the seas run high and I feel ill.
