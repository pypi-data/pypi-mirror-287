    content: |
      At a point of life when one is through with boyhood, but has
      not yet discovered how to be a man, it was my fortune to travel with
      the most marvelously appealing of teams.

      In the intimacy of Ebbets Field it was a short trip from the
      grandstand to the fantasy you were in the game.

      You may glory in a team triumphant, but you fall in love with
      a team in defeat. Losing after great striving is the story of man,
      who was born to sorrow, whose sweetest songs tell of saddest thought,
      and who, if he is a hero, does nothing in life as becomingly as leaving
      it.

      One did not go to Ebbets Field for sociology. Exciting baseball
      was the attraction, and a wonder of the sociological Brooklyn Dodgers
      was the excitement of their play.

      He bore the burden of a pioneer and the weight made him strong.
      If one can be certain of anything in baseball, it is that we shall
      not look upon his like again.

      Unlike most, a ball player must confront two deaths. First,
      between the ages of thirty and forty he perishes as an athlete. Although
      he looks trim and feels vigorous and retains unusual coordination,
      the superlative reflexes, the major league reflexes, pass on. At a
      point when many of his classmates are newly confident and rising in
      other fields, he finds that he can no longer hit a very good fast
      ball or reach a grounder four strides to his right. At thirty-five
      he is is experiencing the truth of finality. As his major league career
      is ending, all things will end. However he sprang, he was always earthbound.
      Mortality embraces him. The golden age has passed in a moment. So
      will all things. So will all moments.

      One thing a writer has, if he is fortunate, and I have been
      fortunate, is a partnership with the years.

      Surely these fine athletes, those boys of summer, have found
      their measure of ruin.

      That morning began with wind and hairy clouds. It was late
      March and the day rose brisk and uncertain, with gusts suggesting
      January and flashes of sun promising June. In every way, a season
      of change had come.

    intro: Roger Kahn
    content: |
      It was a time of transition, which few recognized, and glutting
      national satisfaction. Students and scholars were silent.

      One can travel for weeks with baseball men and see no books
      at all.

    intro: Roger Kahn
    content: |
      No game is as verbal as baseball; baseball spreads twenty minutes
      of action across three hours of a day.

    intro: Roger Kahn
    content: |
      Baseball skill relates inversely to age. The older a man gets,
      the better a ball player he was when young, according to the watery
      eye of memory.

      What did it matter, Babe Ruth or Jersey Joe Stripp? If vector
      analysis was beyond me, I could still watch a ball game.

    content: |
      In the dead sunlight of a forgotten spring the major leaguers
      were trim, graceful and effortless. They might have been gods for
      these seemed true Olympians to a boy who wanted to become a manand
      who sensed that it was an exalted manly thing to catch a ball with
      one hand thrust across your body and make a crowd leap to its feet
      and cheer.

      The world is never again as it was before anyone you love has
      ever died; never so innocent, never so fixed, never so gentle, never
      so pliant to your will. But these are afterthoughts. Generations vie
      and the young recover swiftly, or believe they do.

      When the wind blew from the south and the French doors had
      been opened, the sound of cheering carried from Ebbets Field into
      the apartment. It was astonishing, to hear cheers from a major league
      crowd while sitting at home.

    intro: Roger Kahn
    content: |
      At carefree times in early boyhood I chose to believe that
      life was a kind of ball game, but with a mix of years and perception
      I learned better.

    intro: Roger Kahn
    content: |
      I never heard a thrown ball make that sound before. The ball
      seemed to accelerate as it came close; an accelerating, impossibly
      fast pitch that made the noises of hornets and snakes.

    intro: Quotes from Thomas A. Edison
    content: |
      I owe my success to the fact that I never had a clock in my
      workroom. Seventy-five of us worked twenty hours every day and slept
      only four hours - and thrived on it.

    intro: Quotes from Thomas A. Edison
    content: |
      Tom Paine has almost no influence on present-day thinking in
      the United States because he is unknown to the average citizen. Perhaps
      I might say right here that this is a national loss and a deplorable
      lack of understanding concerning the man who first proposed and first
      wrote those impressive words, 'the United States of America.' But
      it is hardly strange. Paine's teachings have been debarred from schools
      everywhere and his views of life misrepresented until his memory is
      hidden in shadows, or he is looked upon as of unsound mind. We never
      had a sounder intelligence in this Republic. He was the equal of Washington
      in making American liberty possible. Where Washington performed Paine
      devised and wrote. The deeds of one in the Weld were matched by the
      deeds of the other with his pen.
