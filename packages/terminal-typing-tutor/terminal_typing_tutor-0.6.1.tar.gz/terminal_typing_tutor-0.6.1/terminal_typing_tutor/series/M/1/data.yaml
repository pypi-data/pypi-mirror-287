      Often 25% of first-year students never do 25 words a minute.
      Many second-year students can type about 45 words a minute.
      More than 50% do not equal the practical rate of 50 words.

      Why do we all thrill over sports?  Maybe it is the tireless
      skill of the winner that we feel.  Ask the players.  They
      may agree (Rice,* famous as a sports writer, said the cham-
      pions all agreed) that skill is only part (50%) of it.

      "When you step on the first tee," says the four-time gold
      champion, Bobby Jones, "you know you can't afford to make
      one careless slip."  A tired Bobby Jones (this was the way
      Bobby told it to Rice) has stood on the 16th tee, leading
      Smith by 18 strokes.

      "Up to this point," says Bobby, "I had played 33 holes in 11
      under par.  I believe it was the best golf I ever played in
      my life.  But after easing up on the mental side I played
      the last three holes in 5 over par."

      In 1919 Babe Ruth shot into the records with 29 home runs.
      Yet few know that the Babe worked five years in big games
      before this start that led past Home Run #600.  You may
      have cheered Jimmy Foxx and many another.  Yet you can still
      picture the Babe after two strikes, smashing to the very
      spot he had "called" a famous home run.

      It is the effort against odds that thrills.  We feel these
      drives that never let down.  We feel (this was the way Rice
      put it) the champion forces himself into the winning frame of
      mind.  Can the fast typist afford to do less?  A typist has
      to face such days of "mental torture" too.  Some days he has
      to force himself along.  He need not punish his machine.  He
      must pull himself together (100%) to type his steady, smooth
      way over all upsets.

      (9A) Pointed Paragraph (m b)
    content: | 
      Men are bound to believe that business is bad in winter
      months.  Maybe Mr. Smith remembers that most building became
      better in September but both November and December seemed to
      be much behind.  Monday morning my mail box became blocked
      by urgent requests of many families that small-sized homes
      be built.  Some jobs may begin to come now from the Chamber
      of Commerce members.
