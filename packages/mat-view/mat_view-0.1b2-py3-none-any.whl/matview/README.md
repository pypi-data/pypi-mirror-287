The present application offers a set of web tools to support the user in the visualization of multiple aspect trajectories and movelets (the parts of the trajectory that better discriminate a class). Also, present a detailed list of available datasets on a public repository, descriptions of MAT data mining methods, experimental results exploration, environmental and scripting generators. It integrates into a unique platform of the approaches available for multiple aspects trajectories and in general for multidimensional sequence classification into a unique web-based and python library system.
