## Overview

The `dvinci_api` package provides a Python interface for interacting with the Dvinci RestAPI. It allows developers to easily connect to the API, perform CRUD operations, and manage various resources related to job publications, locations, organizational units, and more.

### Features

-   **Job Publications**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete job publications.
-   **Locations**: Access and manage location information.
-   **Organizational Units**: Manage organizational units and their details.
-   **User Management**: Handle users and user groups within the system.
-   **Authentication**: Simplified authentication process using API tokens.

## Getting Started

Before using the package, you need to obtain an API token from the Dvinci platform. The token is used to authenticate your requests and access the API endpoints. You can generate an API token by following these steps:

1. **Log in to Dvinci**: Go to the Dvinci platform and log in to your account.
2. **Generate API Token**: Navigate to the user settings and search for your API user. Generate a new API token and copy it to your clipboard.
3. **Use the Token**: When making requests to the API, include the API token in the `Authorization` header.

```python
# To be edited...
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install dvinci_api
```
