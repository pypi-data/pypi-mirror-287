Features
--------

Installation
------------

``lsbi`` can be installed via pip

.. code:: bash

    pip install lsbi

via conda

.. code:: bash

    conda install -c handley-lab lsbi

or via the github repository

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/handley-lab/lsbi
    cd lsbi
    python -m pip install .

You can check that things are working by running the test suite:

.. code:: bash

    python -m pytest
    black .
    isort --profile black .
    pydocstyle --convention=numpy lsbi


Dependencies

    sphinx-apidoc -fM -t docs/templates/ -o docs/source/ lsbi/

Citation
--------

If you use ``lsbi`` to generate results for a publication, please cite
as: ::

   Handley et al, (2024) lsbi: Linear Simulation Based Inference. 

or using the BibTeX:

.. code:: bibtex

   @article{lsbi,
       year  = {2023},
       author = {Will Handley et al},
       title = {lsbi: Linear Simulation Based Inference},
       journal = {In preparation}
   }


Contributing
------------
There are many ways you can contribute via the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/handley-lab/lsbi>`__.

- You can `open an issue <https://github.com/handley-lab/lsbi/issues>`__ to report bugs or to propose new features.
- Pull requests are very welcome. Note that if you are going to propose major changes, be sure to open an issue for discussion first, to make sure that your PR will be accepted before you spend effort coding it.
