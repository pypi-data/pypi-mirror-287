# LangString Python Library

LangString is a Python library designed to handle multilingual text data with precision and flexibility. Although the need for robust management of multilingual content is critical, existing solutions often lack the necessary features to manage language-tagged strings, sets of strings, and collections of multilingual strings effectively. LangString addresses this gap by providing classes and utilities that enable the creation, manipulation, and validation of multilingual text data consistently and accurately. Inspired by [RDFS's langstrings](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/), LangString integrates seamlessly into Python applications, offering familiar methods that mimic those of regular Python types, making it intuitive for developers to adopt and use.

**ðŸ“¦ PyPI Package:**
The library is conveniently [available as a PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/langstring/), allowing users to easily import it into other Python projects.

**ðŸ“š Documentation:**
For detailed documentation and code examples, please refer to the library's [docstring-generated documentation](https://pedropaulofb.github.io/langstring).

## Installation and Use

### Basic Installation

Install with:

```bash
pip install langstring
```

## Dependencies

The LangString Python Library is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind. To achieve this, we have minimized external dependencies.

The LangString Library depends only on the [langcodes package](https://pypi.org/project/langcodes/), particularly for validating language tags when the `ENSURE_VALID_LANG` flag is enabled. This dependency is crucial for ensuring that language tags used in `LangString` and `MultiLangString` instances are valid and conform to international standards, thereby maintaining the integrity and reliability of multilingual text processing.

This project can be set up using either Poetry or `requirements.txt`. Both are kept in sync to ensure consistency in dependencies.

### Installation of Extra Dependencies

### Installation of Dev Dependencies

### Using Poetry

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is used for easy management of dependencies and packaging. To install the dependencies with Poetry, first [install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) if you haven't already, and then run:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will install all the dependencies as specified in `pyproject.toml`.

### Using `requirements.txt`

If you prefer not to use Poetry, a `requirements.txt` file is also provided. You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This is a straightforward way to set up the project if you are accustomed to using pip and traditional requirements files.

### Usage

After installation, you can use the `LangString` and `MultiLangString` classes in your project. Simply import the classes and start encapsulating strings with their language tags.

```python
from langstring import LangString, MultiLangString, Controller, LangStringFlag, MultiLangStringFlag
```

## Main Elements

### LangStrings

The `LangString` class is a fundamental component of the LangString Library, designed to encapsulate a single string along with its associated language information. It is primarily used in scenarios where the language context of a text string is crucial, such as in multilingual applications, content management systems, or any software that deals with language-specific data. The class provides a structured way to manage text strings, ensuring that each piece of text is correctly associated with its respective language.

In the LangString class, the string representation format varies based on the presence of a language tag. When a language tag is provided, the format is `text`. Without a language tag, it is formatted as `"text"@lang`, where lang is the language code.

### SetLangStrings

TODO

### MultiLangStrings

The `MultiLangString` class is a key component of the LangString Library, designed to manage and manipulate text strings across multiple languages. This class is particularly useful in applications that require handling of text in a multilingual context, such as websites, applications with internationalization support, and data processing tools that deal with multilingual data. The primary purpose of `MultiLangString` is to store, retrieve, and manipulate text entries in various languages, offering a flexible and efficient way to handle multilingual content.


### Controller and Flags

The Control and Flags system in the LangString Library plays a pivotal role in managing and configuring the behavior of `LangString` and `MultiLangString` instances.

This system operates at a global, class-level context, meaning that the flags and controls applied have a uniform effect across all instances of these classes. In other words, when a flag is set or reset using the control classes, it impacts every instance of `LangString` and `MultiLangString` throughout the application. This ensures consistent behavior and validation rules across all instances, as individual instances cannot have differing flag values.

In the following subsections, we will delve into the specifics of the available flags and the control methods. The flags define key aspects of how `LangString` and `MultiLangString` instances handle multilingual text, including validation rules and representation formats. Understanding these flags is crucial for effectively utilizing the library in various scenarios, especially those involving multilingual content.

The control methods, shared between `Controller` and `MultiLangStringControl`, provide the mechanisms to set, retrieve, and reset these flags. These methods ensure that you can dynamically configure the behavior of the library to suit your application's needs. We will explore each method in detail, providing insights into their usage and impact on the library's functionality.

The LangString and MultiLangString classes use a set of flags to control various aspects of their behavior. These flags are managed by `Controller` and `MultiLangStringControl` respectively. The flags provide a flexible way to customize the behavior of `LangString` and `MultiLangString` classes according to the specific needs of your application. By adjusting these flags, you can enforce different levels of validation and control over the language data being processed. The available flags and their effects are as follows.

The Control classes, namely `Controller` and `MultiLangStringControl`, act as static managers for the flags. They provide methods to set, retrieve, and reset the states of these flags, ensuring consistent behavior across all instances of `LangString` and `MultiLangString`.
