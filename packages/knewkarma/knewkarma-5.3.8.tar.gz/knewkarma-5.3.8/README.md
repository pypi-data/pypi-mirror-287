## Important Note on Data Fetching

Knew Karma is designed to fetch recent data from Reddit. It directly interacts with the Reddit API to access up-to-date
information, including the latest posts, comments, and user activity.

If you need to access historical Reddit data, I recommend using the [Pushshift API](https://api.pushshift.io/docs),
which is
specifically designed for retrieving large volumes of historical data, including posts, comments, and
other Reddit activity.
