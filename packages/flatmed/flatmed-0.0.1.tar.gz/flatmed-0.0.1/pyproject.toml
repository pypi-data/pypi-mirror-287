description = "A simple package for converting PubMed output (ie, the output from PubMed with all PubMed fields) into a flat file or pandas.DataFrame object. Simple functions are provided to merge the results of separate searches and automatically create variables indicating which search(es) a record was found in. Users can then add their own notes on the references by importing the flat file into a spreadsheet program of their choice and adding their notes in new columns."
