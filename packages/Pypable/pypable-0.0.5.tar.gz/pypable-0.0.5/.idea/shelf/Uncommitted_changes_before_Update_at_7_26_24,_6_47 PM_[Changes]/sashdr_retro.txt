 |
 | NOTE: This setup file was produced solely from the study documentation,
 | independent of the data.
 |
 | SAS setup sections are provided for the ASCII version of this data
 | collection.  These sections are listed below:
 |
 | PROC FORMAT:  creates user-defined formats for the variables. Formats
 | replace original value codes with value code descriptions. Only
 | variables with user-defined formats are included in this section.
 |
 | DATA:  begins a SAS data step and names an output SAS data set.
 |
 | INFILE:  identifies the input file to be read with the input statement.
 | Users must replace the "data-filename" with a filename specifying the
 | directory on the user's computer system in which the downloaded and
 | unzipped data file is physically located (e.g.,
 | "c:\temp\NNNNN-QQQQ-data.txt").
 |
 | INPUT:  assigns the name, type, decimal specification (if any), and
 | specifies the beginning and ending column locations for each variable
 | in the data file.
 |
 | LABEL:  assigns descriptive labels to all variables. Variable labels
 | and variable names may be identical for some variables.
 |
 | MISSING VALUE RECODES:  sets user-defined numeric missing values to
 | missing as interpreted by the SAS system. Only variables with
 | user-defined missing values are included in this section.
 |
 | If any variables have more than one missing value, they are assigned
 | to the standard missing value of a single period (.) in the statement
 | below. To maintain the original meaning of missing codes, users may want
 | to take advantage of the SAS missing values (the letters A-Z or an
 | underscore preceded by a period).
 | 
 | An example of a standard missing value recode:
 |
 |    IF (RELATION = 98 OR RELATION = 99) THEN RELATION = .;
 |
 | The same example using special missing value recodes:
 |
 |    IF RELATION = 98 THEN RELATION = .A;
 |    IF RELATION = 99 THEN RELATION = .B;
 | 
 | FORMAT:  associates the formats created by the PROC FORMAT step with
 | the variables named in the INPUT statement.
 |
 | NOTE:  Users should modify this setup file to suit their specific needs.
 | Sections for PROC FORMAT, FORMAT, and MISSING VALUE RECODES have been
 | commented out (i.e., '/*'). To include these sections in the final SAS
 | setup, users should remove the SAS comment indicators from the desired
 | section(s).
