# Python pretty logger
Simple colorizer for python outputs. Has some useful features for approaching the behavior of print, but we are not there yet :)

Example:
```python
import pretlog as pl

pl.error("This is an error message")
pl.warning("This is a warning message")
pl.info("This is an info message")
pl.valid("This is a valid message")
```
