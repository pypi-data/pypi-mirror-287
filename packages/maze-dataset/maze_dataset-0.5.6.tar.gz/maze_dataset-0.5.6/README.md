# `maze-dataset`

This package provides utilities for generation, filtering, solving, visualizing, and processing of mazes for training ML systems. Primarily built for the [maze-transformer interpretability](https://github.com/understanding-search/maze-transformer) project. You can find our paper on it here: http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10498

This package includes a variety of [maze generation algorithms](maze_dataset/generation/generators.py), including randomized depth first search, Wilson's algorithm for uniform spanning trees, and percolation. Datasets can be filtered to select mazes of a certain length or complexity, remove duplicates, and satisfy custom properties. A variety of output formats for visualization and training ML models are provided.

# Usage

Most of the functionality is demonstrated in the ipython notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.

- [`demo_dataset.ipynb`](notebooks/demo_dataset.ipynb) how to easily create a dataset of mazes, utilities for filtering the generates mazes via properties, and basic visualization. View this one first.
- [`demo_tokenization.ipynb`](notebooks/demo_tokenization.ipynb) converting mazes to and from textual representations, as well as utilities for working with them.
- [`demo_latticemaze.ipynb`](notebooks/demo_latticemaze.ipynb) internals of the `LatticeMaze` and `SolvedMaze` objects, and advanced visualization.

## Creating a dataset

To create a `MazeDataset`, which inherits from `torch.utils.data.Dataset`, you first create a `MazeDatasetConfig`:

```python
from maze_dataset import MazeDataset, MazeDatasetConfig
from maze_dataset.generation import LatticeMazeGenerators
cfg: MazeDatasetConfig = MazeDatasetConfig(
	name="test", # name is only for you to keep track of things
	grid_n=5, # number of rows/columns in the lattice
	n_mazes=4, # number of mazes to generate
	maze_ctor=LatticeMazeGenerators.gen_dfs, # algorithm to generate the maze
    maze_ctor_kwargs=dict(do_forks=False), # additional parameters to pass to the maze generation algorithm
)
```

and then pass this config to the `MazeDataset.from_config` factory method:

```python
dataset: MazeDataset = MazeDataset.from_config(
    # your config
	cfg,
    # and all this below is completely optional
	# do_download=False,
	# load_local=False,
	# do_generate=True,
    # save_local=True,
	# gen_parallel=False,
)
```

This method can search for whether a dataset with matching config hash already exists on your filesystem in the expected location, and load it if so. It can also generate a dataset on the fly if needed.

## Conversions to useful formats

The elements of the dataset are [`SolvedMaze`](maze_dataset/maze/lattice_maze.py) objects:
```python
>>> m = dataset[0]
>>> type(m)
maze_dataset.maze.lattice_maze.SolvedMaze
```

Which can be converted to a variety of formats:
```python
# visual representation as ascii art
m.as_ascii() 
# RGB image, optionally without solution or endpoints, suitable for CNNs
m.as_pixels() 
# text format for autoreregressive transformers
from maze_dataset.tokenization import MazeTokenizer, TokenizationMode
m.as_tokens(maze_tokenizer=MazeTokenizer(
    tokenization_mode=TokenizationMode.AOTP_UT_rasterized, max_grid_size=100,
))
# advanced visualization with many features
from maze_dataset.plotting import MazePlot
MazePlot(maze).plot()
```

# Installation
This package is [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/maze-dataset/), and can be installed via
```
pip install maze-dataset
```


# Development

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for development. To install with dev requirements, run
```
poetry install --with dev
```

A makefile is included to simplify common development tasks:

- `make help` will print all available commands
- all tests via `make test`
    - unit tests via `make unit`
    - notebook tests via `make test_notebooks`
- formatter (black, pycln, and isort) via `make format`
    - formatter in check-only mode via `make check-format`
