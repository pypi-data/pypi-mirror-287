# SecureKeyz

SecureKeyz is a Python-based command-line tool designed to help you securely manage your API keys. It allows you to store, modify, and transfer API keys between different services while keeping them encrypted.

## Features

- **Secure Storage**: Encrypts API keys before storing them in a JSON file.
- **Service Management**: Add new services or manage existing ones.
- **Key Management**: Add, modify, and transfer keys between services.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Easy-to-use CLI with prompt-based interaction.

## Installation

You can install SecureKeyz via pip:

```sh
pip install securekeyz
```

## Usage

To use SecureKeyz, run the script with the desired command-line arguments. Here are some examples:

### Add a New API Key

To add a new API key to a service:

```sh
securekeyz --add
```

This command will prompt you to select an existing service or create a new one, and then to enter the API key and its description.

### Modify an Existing API Key

To modify an existing API key:

```sh
securekeyz --modify INDEX
```

This command will prompt you to select a service and the key index you want to modify. You can then enter the new key and its description.

### List Services and Keys

Running the script without arguments will list the existing services and their keys:

```sh
securekeyz
```

## Commands

- `--ser`: Specify the service for which you want to add or view keys.
- `--add`: Add a new API key for the specified service.
- `--modify INDEX`: Modify an existing API key for the specified service (provide index).

## Examples

### Add a Key to a New Service

```sh
securekeyz --add
```

### Modify a Key in an Existing Service

```sh
securekeyz --modify 1
```

### List All Services and Keys

```sh
